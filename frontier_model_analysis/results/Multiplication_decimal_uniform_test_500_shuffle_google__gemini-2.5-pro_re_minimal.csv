My initial instinct, as always, is to get a handle on the magnitude.  I see a number near 6300 and another near 27, so I'm thinking of simplifying the calculation for an estimate.  I'm mentally rounding 6301.711669387 down to 6300 and 26.780307156747 up to 27. This feels like a good starting point for a quick approximation.  Now, instead of 6300*27, I'm thinking 63 * 27 * 100. That's a bit easier to visualize.  To make the multiplication of 63 and 27 more manageable, I'll think of 27 as (30 - 3). This lets me rewrite the problem as: 63 * (30 - 3) = (63*30) - (63*3).  63 multiplied by 30 is relatively easy: 63*3 = 189, so 63*30 = 1890.  Then 63 multiplied by 3 is the same 189.  Thus, my approximation is now 1890 - 189 = 1701.  Since I remember that I had the factor of 100 as well, I can quickly estimate that the product of the given numbers should be close to 170100.

Since I'm multiplying two negatives, I know the answer will be positive, so really I just need to figure out 136 times 0.0000139712.  Let's break this down to make it easier to manage. I'll multiply 136 by 139712, and then adjust for the decimal place later.  I'm thinking: 136 * 0.0000139712 is the same as (136 * 139712) * 10^-8.  Now, to multiply 136 by 139712, I'll use a distributive approach.  I'll break 136 into 100 + 30 + 6, and multiply each of those parts by 139712.  So, it becomes: (100 * 139712) + (30 * 139712) + (6 * 139712).  For 30 * 139712, that's the same as 3 * 1397120. I'll break that 3 * 1397120 down: * 3 * 1000000 = 3000000 * 3 * 300000 = 900000 * 3 * 90000 = 270000 * 3 * 7000 = 21000 * 3 * 100 = 300 * 3 * 20 = 60 Adding those up gives 4191360.  For 6 * 139712, I'll do a similar breakdown: * 6 * 100000 = 600000 * 6 * 30000 = 180000 * 6 * 9000 = 54000 * 6 * 700 = 4200 * 6 * 10 = 60 * 6 * 2 = 12 Adding those up gives 838272.  Now, to finish 136 * 139712: 13971200 + 4191360 + 838272 = 19000832  So, 136 * 139712 equals 19000832.

Now to calculate 8.3 * 7.5, which I can break down mentally. 8.3 times 7 is 58.1, and 8.3 times 0.5 is 4.15. Adding those, I get 62.25. So, the product is roughly -62.25 * 10, giving me -622.5.
