So dividing 1,224,033,610 by 5 gives exactly 244,806,722. So the integer part of mean is 244,806,722. Then we add the fractional part 2.5839269/5 = 0.51678538. So mean = 244,806,722.51678538.  But earlier I mistakenly added 0.4. Let's verify: The sum of integer parts is 5 * 244,806,722 = 1,224,033,610. Yes. So mean integer part is 244,806,722. Then fractional part as above.  Thus answer: 244,806,722.51678538.

Wait add: 0.5822834 + 0.5826830 = 1.1649664, carry 1 to integer part. So integer part: 9,412,621 + 9,412,621 = 18,825,242 plus carry 1 = 18,825,243. So sum = 18,825,243.1649664. Yes.

Decimal part: 0.1649664 + 0.5831849 = 0.7481513 (no carry). Integer part: 18,825,243 + 9,412,621 = 28,237,864. So total = 28,237,864.7481513.  Now divide by 3.  28,237,864.7481513 / 3 = ?  Compute: 28,200,000/3 = 9,400,000. Remainder 37,864.7481513/3 = 12,621.5827171? Let's do precise division.  We can do long division: 28,237,864.7481513 ÷ 3.  3 goes into 28 => 9 remainder 1. So 9, remainder 1 => 12 => 4 remainder 0. Actually let's just compute using arithmetic: divide each part.  28,237,864.7481513 / 3 = 9,412,621.5827171? Let's check: Multiply 9,412,621.5827171 *3 = 28,237,864.7481513 (approx). Since original numbers are around 9,412,621.58, the mean should be close to that.  We can compute average of three numbers: (a+b+c)/3. Since they are close, we can also compute mean by taking first number plus differences.  But let's compute precisely: sum = 28,237,864.7481513.  Now divide by 3:  28,237,864 ÷3 = 9,412,621 remainder? 9,412,621*3 = 28,237,863. So remainder 1. So integer part 9,412,621.  Now decimal part: we have .7481513 plus remainder 1 (i.e., 1.7481513) to be divided by 3.  Actually we had sum = 28,237,864.7481513. Subtract 3*9,412,621 = 28,237,863. Remainder = 1.7481513.  Now divide remainder by 3: 1.7481513 /3 = 0.5827171 (since 1.5/3=0.5, plus 0.2481513/3=0.0827171). Let's compute precisely: 1.7481513 /3 = 0.5827171 (since 0.5827171*3 = 1.7481513). Yes.

Here 1.393435189337175 has 16 significant digits (including the leading 1). Need at most 15. So we should round to 15 significant digits.  Let's count: digits: 1 (first), then decimal digits: 3 9 3 4 3 5 1 8 9 3 3 7 1 7 5. That's 15 after decimal? Let's count: after decimal we have 15 digits? Let's list: 3(1),9(2),3(3),4(4),3(5),5(6),1(7),8(8),9(9),3(10),3(11),7(12),1(13),7(14),5(15). So total significant digits = 1 + 15 = 16. Need 15 max. So we need to round to 15 significant digits total. That means we need 14 decimal places (since leading 1 counts as one). So we keep 14 decimal digits after decimal.  Current value: 1.393435189337175  We need 14 decimal digits: keep up to 14th decimal place.  Let's write decimal digits with positions:  1 . 3 9 3 4 3 5 1 8 9 3 3 7 1 7 5 positions after decimal: 1:3 2:9 3:3 4:4 5:3 6:5 7:1 8:8 9:9 10:3 11:3 12:7 13:1 14:7 15:5  We need 14 decimal digits, so we keep up to position 14 (digit 7). The 15th digit is 5, which will round up the 14th digit.  So we have 1.39343518933717? Wait we need to round at 14th digit.  Current first 14 decimal digits: 3 9 3 4 3 5 1 8 9 3 3 7 1 7  That's 1.39343518933717  Now look at 15th digit = 5, so round up the last kept digit (7) by 1 => becomes 8.  Thus result: 1.39343518933718  Check if rounding carries over: last digit 7 becomes 8, no further carry.  Thus final answer with 15 significant digits: 1.39343518933718 (that's 1 + 14 = 15 digits). Good.  Return JSON.",942,229,1171,,,666,,0,0,224,0.00059955,False,,3.435e-05,0.0005652

Let's compute.  First, write in scientific:  a = 9.11268e-10? Wait 0.000000000911268 = 9.11268e-10? Actually 0.000000000 = 9 zeros after decimal? Let's count: 0.000000000911268: after decimal, there are 9 zeros then 911268. So that's 9 zeros => 10^-9? Actually 0.000000001 = 1e-9. So 0.000000000911268 = 9.11268e-10? Let's check: 1e-9 = 0.000000001. This number is slightly less: 0.000000000911268 = 9.11268e-10 indeed.  Second: 0.00000000112902 = 1.12902e-9.  Third: -0.0000000000505443 = -5.05443e-11? Let's count zeros: 0.0000000000505443: after decimal, 9 zeros then 505443? Actually 0.000000000 = 9 zeros then digits. So that's 5.05443e-11? Wait 1e-10 = 0.0000000001 (9 zeros then 1). So 5.05443e-11 = 0.0000000000505443 indeed. So negative.  Now sum: a + b + c.  Convert to same exponent maybe 1e-10.  a = 9.11268e-10 b = 1.12902e-9 = 11.2902e-10 c = -5.05443e-11 = -0.505443e-10  Sum in e-10: 9.11268 + 11.2902 - 0.505443 = (9.11268 + 11.2902) = 20.40288; minus 0.505443 = 19.897437.  So sum = 19.897437e-10 = 1.9897437e-9.  Mean = sum / 3 = (1.9897437e-9)/3 = 0.6632479e-9? Let's compute: 1.9897437 /3 = 0.6632479 (since 1.9897437/3 = 0.6632479). So mean = 0.6632479e-9 = 6.632479e-10.  Now express decimal: 6.632479e-10 = 0.0000000006632479? Let's count: 1e-9 = 0.000000001. So 6.632479e-10 = 0.0000000006632479 (9 zeros then digits). Yes.  We need up to 15 significant digits. Provide as decimal.  Thus answer: 0.0000000006632479.  Check rounding: we have 7 decimal digits after the leading zeros? Actually we have 10 decimal places after decimal? Let's count: 0.0000000006632479 has 9 zeros then 6632479 (7 digits). That's 16 significant digits? Actually leading zeros not count.

Actually total significant digits: ignoring leading zeros, digits: 7,2,5,6,9,9,1,0,3,8,4,9,4,1,3,8 = 16? Let's count: 72 (2), then decimal digits: 56991038494138 (14). Total 16. Need at most 15. So we can round to 15 significant digits.  Significant digits start from first non-zero: 7 (first), then 2 (2), then decimal digits. So we need 15 total.  We have currently 16. Let's round to 15 significant digits.  Write number: 72.5699103849414? Let's count.  Digits: 7(1),2(2),5(3),6(4),9(5),9(6),1(7),0(8),3(9),8(10),4(11),9(12),4(13),1(14),4(15). So 72.5699103849414 has 15 significant digits. Need to round appropriately from original 72.569910384941375.  Look at next digit after the 15th significant digit: we have digits list: 7 2 . 5 6 9 9 1 0 3 8 4 9 4 1 3 7 5? Wait we need to map.  Original: 72.569910384941375  Write without decimal: 7 2 5 6 9 9 1 0 3 8 4 9 4 1 3 7 5  Count: 1:7,2:2,3:5,4:6,5:9,6:9,7:1,8:0,9:3,10:8,11:4,12:9,13:4,14:1,15:3,16:7,17:5  We need 15 significant digits, so keep up to digit 15 (which is 3). Next digit (16th) is 7, which is >=5, so round up the 15th digit.  So we have digits up to 15: 7 2 5 6 9 9 1 0 3 8 4 9 4 1 3  Now rounding: last kept digit is 3, next is 7 => round up to 4.  Thus the 15-digit rounded number becomes: digits: 7 2 5 6 9 9 1 0 3 8 4 9 4 1 4  Now place decimal after first two digits (since original had 2 integer digits).

Subtract from 15,487,873,022.293861 gives remainder 2.293861.  So mean = 5,162,624,340 + (2.293861 / 3) = 5,162,624,340 + 0.764620333...  Compute 2.293861 / 3 = 0.764620333... because 2.293861 / 3 = 0.764620333333...  Thus mean = 5,162,624,340.764620333333...  We need round to at most 15 significant digits.

Let's write to 15 significant digits: The number is 5.162624340764620e9? But we need decimal representation.  Digits: 5 1 6 2 6 2 4 3 4 0 . 7 6 4 6 2 0 3 3 3 ...  Count: before decimal we have 10 digits (5162624340). That's already 10 significant digits. Need 5 more after decimal to reach 15 total. So we keep first 5 decimal digits: .76462. But we need rounding based on next digit (6th decimal). The decimal digits are .764620... The 6th decimal digit is 0 (since .764620...). Actually after .76462 we have 0 then 3... So rounding to 5 decimal places .76462 stays same.  Thus answer: 5162624340.76462.  Check: The mean likely equals that because the numbers are symmetric around that value? Let's verify: The three numbers: 0.764616, 0.76462, 0.764625. Their average = (0.764616+0.76462+0.764625)/3 = (2.293861)/3 = 0.764620333... So indeed .764620333..., not .76462 exactly. But rounding to 5 decimal places gives .76462. However the requirement is up to 15 significant digits, we can give more precise: 5162624340.76462033333333? Let's compute more precisely: 2.293861 / 3 = 0.7646203333333333... repeating 3. So mean = 5162624340.764620333333333.  We can give up to 15 significant digits: we have 10 integer digits, need 5 more: 0.76462 (that's 5 digits after decimal). But we could also give 15 significant digits total: 5162624340.76462 (that's 15 digits? Count: digits: 5 1 6 2 6 2 4 3 4 0 (10) then 7 6 4 6 2 (5) = 15). So that's fine.

Let's count significant digits: number is ~8.359710878963864e5. 15 significant digits: 835971.087896386 (that's 15 digits ignoring decimal? Let's count: digits: 8 3 5 9 7 1 (6) then after decimal 0 8 7 8 9 6 3 8 6 (9) total 15. So 835971.087896386. That matches rounding from ...38636 to ...386? Actually we have ...38636, rounding to 15 sig digits gives ...3864? Let's see: digits: 8 3 5 9 7 1 . 0 8 7 8-zero digit 8. Count 15 digits: 1:8,2:3,3:5,4:9,5:7,6:1,7:0,8:8,9:7,10:8,11:9,12:6,13:3,14:8,15:6. So the 15th digit is the second 6 after decimal? Actually after decimal we have 0 (7th),8(8th),7(9th),8(10th),9(11th),6(12th),3(13th),8(14th),6(15th). Next digit is 3 (16th) which would round down. So result: 835971.087896386.

Now after decimal point, we have remainder 2 (since after processing integer part we have remainder 2). Bring down decimal digits from .588395.  Remainder 2, bring down 5 (first decimal digit is 5) => 25/3 = 8 remainder 1 (8*3=24). So first decimal digit 8.  Remainder 1, bring down 8 => 18/3 = 6 remainder 0. Next digit 6.  Remainder 0, bring down 8 => 8/3 = 2 remainder 2. Digit 2.  Remainder 2, bring down 3 => 23/3 = 7 remainder 2. Digit 7.  Remainder 2, bring down 9 => 29/3 = 9 remainder 2. Digit 9.  Remainder 2, bring down 5 => 25/3 = 8 remainder 1. Digit 8.  Remainder 1, bring down ? we have more digits? original decimal .588395 has 6 digits, we used all: 5,8,8,3,9,5. Wait we used 5,8,8,3,9,5? Let's track: after integer part, we had .588395. We processed digits sequentially:  - digit 5 -> gave 8 remainder1 - digit 8 -> gave 6 remainder0 - digit 8 -> gave 2 remainder2 - digit 3 -> gave 7 remainder2 - digit 9 -> gave 9 remainder2 - digit 5 -> gave 8 remainder1  Now remainder 1, we could continue with zeros.  Bring down 0 => 10/3 = 3 remainder1. Digit 3.  Bring down 0 => 10/3 = 3 remainder1. Digit 3 again.  So decimal expansion: .86279833... Let's list digits: after decimal we got 8,6,2,7,9,8,3,3,...  Thus mean = 241,787,687.86279833... Let's round to at most 15 significant digits. The number is about 2.417876878627983e8. Significant digits count from first non-zero digit. Provide maybe 15 digits total.  Current digits: 241787687.86279833  Count significant digits: all digits except leading zeros. That's 9 digits before decimal + after decimal until 15 total. Need 15 significant digits: we have 9 before decimal, need 6 after decimal. So we can give 241787687.862799 (rounded). Let's round the 6th decimal place.  Our decimal part: .86279833... The 6th decimal digit: digits after decimal: 8(1),6(2),2(3),7(4),9(5),8(6),3(7)... So 6th digit is 8. Next digit (7th) is 3, which is less than 5, so round down, keep 8. So .862798.

Let's convert to 1e-12 units.  First number: 0.000098755499375 = 98,755.499375e-9? Let's use 1e-12: multiply by 1e12 => 98,755,499.375? Wait 0.000098755499375 * 1e12 = 98,755,499.375. Similarly second: 0.00009875549936 *1e12 = 98,755,499.36. Third: 0.000098755498712*1e12 = 98,755,498.712.  Now sum in these units: sum = 98,755,499.375 + 98,755,499.36 + 98,755,498.712 = ?  Add first two: 98,755,499.375 + 98,755,499.36 = 197,511, - compute: 98,755,499.375 + 98,755,499.360 = 197,511, - actually 98,755,499.375 + 98,755,499.360 = 197,511, - let's add: 98,755,499.375 + 98,755,499.360 = 197,511, - sum = 197,511, - we need exact: 98,755,499.375 + 98,755,499.360 = 197,511, - add integer part: 98,755,499 + 98,755,499 = 197,510,998. Then decimal .375 + .360 = .735. So total = 197,510,998.735.  Now add third: 98,755,498.712.  197,510,998.735 + 98,755,498.712 = 296,266,497.447.  Thus sum in 1e-12 units = 296,266,497.447.  Now divide by 3: 296,266,497.447 /3 = 98,755,499.149? Let's compute: 3*98,755,499 = 296,266,497. So remainder .447 => .447/3 = 0.149. So result = 98,755,499.149.  Thus mean in original units = 98,755,499.149 *1e-12 = 9.8755499149e-5 = 0.000098755499149.  Check rounding: we have 0.000098755499149.  Let's ensure precision: The sum we computed maybe slight rounding due to decimal representation. Let's double-check using more precise addition.

Let's write with 12 decimal places after decimal? Actually numbers have 12 decimal places after decimal? Let's count: 0.000098755499375 has 12 decimal places after decimal? Let's count digits after decimal: ""000098755499375"" that's 15? Wait decimal representation: 0.000098755499375: after decimal there are 15 digits? Let's count: digits: 0 . 0 0 0 0 9 8 7 5 5 4 9 9 3 7 5? Actually let's write: 0.000098755499375  After decimal: 0 0 0 0 9 8 7 5 5 4 9 9 3 7 5 => that's 15 digits. Similarly second: 0.00009875549936 has 14? Let's count: 0.00009875549936 => after decimal: 0 0 0 0 9 8 7 5 5 4 9 9 3 6 => 14 digits. Third: 0.000098755498712 => after decimal: 0 0 0 0 9 8 7 5 5 4 9 8 7 1 2 => 15 digits.  Our conversion to 1e-12 units used 12 decimal places, but actually they have up to 15 decimal places, so 1e-15 would be better. Let's use 1e-15 units.  Multiply each by 1e15:  a *1e15 = 98,755,499,375,000? Let's compute: 0.000098755499375 *1e15 = 98,755,499,375,000? Because 0.000098755499375 = 9.8755499375e-5. Multiply by 1e15 gives 9.8755499375e10 = 98,755,499,375? Wait check: 0.000098755499375 = 9.8755499375e-5. Multiply by 1e15 => 9.8755499375e10 = 98,755,499,375,000? Actually 9.8755499375e10 = 98,755,499,375? No, 9.8755e10 = 98,755,000,000? Let's compute: 1e-5 *1e15 = 1e10. So 9.8755e-5 *1e15 = 9.8755e10 = 98,755,000,000. So a*1e15 = 98,755,499,375? Wait need exact: a = 0.000098755499375 = 98,755.499375e-9? Let's just compute using 1e-12 earlier gave 98,755,499.375 which seems plausible. Let's verify: a = 0.000098755499375. Multiply by 1e12: 0.000098755499375 * 1e12 = 98,755,499.375. Yes that matches earlier. So using 1e12 gives three decimal places after decimal. That's enough for our precision. The numbers have up to 12 decimal places after decimal? Actually they have 12 digits after decimal beyond the leading zeros? Let's trust 1e12 is fine.  Thus mean = 0.000098755499149.

Now round to at most 15 significant digits. The number has many digits: 6282.26529511875 (14 decimal digits after decimal). Significant digits count includes all digits starting from first non-zero. Here integer part 4 digits, plus decimal digits. 15 significant digits total: we have 4 integer digits, so we can have up to 11 decimal digits. Currently we have 14 decimal digits. Need to round to 11 decimal digits after decimal.  Let's produce 15 significant digits: 6282.26529511875 has 4+14=18 significant digits. Need 15. So keep 11 decimal places.  Take 6282.26529511875 -> keep 11 decimal places: 6282.265295118? Wait count: decimal places after point: we need total significant digits = 15. Integer part 4 digits, so need 11 decimal digits.  Take first 11 decimal digits: after decimal: 2 6 5 2 9 5 1 1 8 7 5 ... Let's list: .26529511875  First 11 digits: 2 6 5 2 9 5 1 1 8 7 5? That's 11 digits: 26529511875. So number = 6282.26529511875 (that's exactly 11 decimal digits). Wait that's 11 decimal digits indeed. So we already have 11 decimal digits. Actually we have 14 decimal digits, but we need 11. So we need to round at the 11th decimal place.  Our number: 6282.26529511875  Decimal digits: position: 1:2 2:6 3:5 4:2 5:9 6:5 7:1 8:1 9:8 10:7 11:5 12:?  We have digits beyond 11? Actually we have 14 digits: after 11th digit (5) we have more digits: we have maybe 0? Let's check original sum more precisely to ensure rounding.  Our computed mean: 25129.061180475 /4 = ?  Let's compute more precisely using division.  25129.061180475 / 2 = 12564.5305902375 Then /2 again = 6282.26529511875. Yes that's exact because original sum had 3 decimal places? Actually sum had 3 decimal places? The numbers have many decimal places, but the division by 4 yields exact terminating decimal because denominator is power of 2. So the result is exact with finite decimal representation limited to the precision of the sum.  Thus 6282.26529511875 is exact with 14 decimal digits after decimal? Let's count: after decimal: 26529511875 (11 digits). Wait that's 11 digits, not 14. Let's count: digits: 2 6 5 2 9 5 1 1 8 7 5 = 11 digits. So it's 11 decimal digits. So total significant digits = 4 + 11 = 15. Perfect. So we can output as is.  Thus answer JSON.",1041,225,1266,,,839,,0,0,160,0.00065835,False,,3.375e-05,0.0006246

Now add positive 0.000673092393766 + (-0.0006721353855462) = 0.000673092393766 - 0.0006721353855462 = difference = 0.000001 (approx). Compute precisely: 0.000673092393766 - 0.0006721353855462 = 0.000001 (0.000001? Let's subtract:  0.000673092393766 -0.0006721353855462 =0.0000009570082198? Let's do subtraction:  Write both with same decimal places: first has 12 decimal places? Actually 0.000673092393766 (12 decimal places after decimal? Let's count: 0.000 673 092 393 766 => that's 12 digits after decimal). Second: 0.0006721353855462 (13 digits after decimal). Align:  First: 0.0006730923937660 (add trailing zero to 13 digits) Second:0.0006721353855462  Subtract:  0.0006730923937660 -0.0006721353855462 =0.0000009570082198  Yes result = 0.0000009570082198.  Now mean = sum / 3 = 0.0000009570082198 / 3 = 0.000000319002739933... Let's compute: 9.570082198e-7 /3 = 3.19002739933e-7.  Compute precisely: 0.0000009570082198 ÷ 3.  Divide: 9.570082198e-7 /3 = 3.190027399333333e-7.  So answer = 3.19002739933e-7 approx. As decimal: 0.000000319002739933.  We need up to 15 significant digits. Let's give 3.19002739933e-7.

Let's compute.  5 * 0.456 = 2.28, remainder 0.002859105206083. Let's do precise division.  2.282859105206083 / 5 = (2.282859105206083 * 0.2) = 0.4565718210412166 (since dividing by 5 is multiply by 0.2). Multiply: 2.282859105206083 * 0.2 = 0.4565718210412166.  Check rounding to 15 significant digits. The number is 0.4565718210412166. That's 16 decimal places but significant digits count from first non-zero. We can give as is. Maybe round to 15 significant digits: Let's count: 0.4565718210412166 -> significant digits start at 4. Count 15 digits: 4 5 6 5 7 1 8 2 1 0 4 1 2 1 6 = 15 digits. That's 0.456571821041216. The next digit is 6 (the 16th), so rounding up? The 16th digit is 6, so round the 15th digit (6) up? Wait we have digits: after decimal: 4 5 6 5 7 1 8 2 1 0 4 1 2 1 6 6... Actually we need to list: 0.4565718210412166 Digits after decimal: 4(1),5(2),6(3),5(4),7(5),1(6),8(7),2(8),1(9),0(10),4(11),1(12),2(13),1(14),6(15),6(16). So 15th digit is 6, 16th is 6, so rounding the 15th digit up? Since next digit 6 >=5, we round up the 15th digit (6) to 7. So we get 0.456571821041217? Let's perform rounding: keep first 15 significant digits: 0.456571821041217 (since rounding up). Let's verify: The 15th significant digit is the 15th digit overall after leading zeros. That's the 6 at position 15. Rounding up gives 7. So final answer 0.456571821041217.  Return JSON.",776,238,1014,,,506,,0,0,192,0.0005013,False,,3.57e-05,0.0004656

That's 17 digits. Need at most 15. So we can round to 15 significant digits.  Significant digits: 0.085893535541257? Let's count: after decimal, first non-zero is 8. So we need 15 digits total from 8 onward.  Digits: 8(1),5(2),8(3),9(4),3(5),5(6),5(7),3(8),5(9),5(10),4(11),1(12),2(13),5(14),6(15),9(16),9(17). So 15th digit is 6. Next digit is 9, so round up. So 15-digit rounding: we keep up to 6, then round up because next digit 9 >=5. So 6 becomes 7, and truncate after that.  Thus result: 0.085893535541257? Wait need to adjust rounding: digits up to 15: 8 5 8 9 3 5 5 3 5 5 4 1 2 5 6. Next digit 9 => round up last digit 6 to 7. So digits become ... 7. So final 15-digit number: 0.085893535541257.  Check length: after decimal we have 15 digits: 085893535541257? Actually count: after decimal: 0? Wait decimal representation: 0.085893535541257. After decimal digits: 0? No the first digit after decimal is 0? Actually number is 0.085... So after decimal we have 0 then 8? Wait 0.085... The digits after decimal: 0,8,5,... But leading zeros after decimal before first non-zero count as significant? In significant digits, leading zeros are not significant. So the first significant digit is 8 (the second digit after decimal). So we need 15 significant digits starting from 8. Our representation 0.085893535541257 has after decimal: 0,8,5,8,9,3,5,3,5,5,4,1,2,5,7. That's 15 digits after the leading zero?

Let's divide.  We can divide the sum by 4: simply shift.  0.0025855739581234392 /4 = 0.0006463934895308598 (since dividing by 2 twice). Let's compute: divide by 2: 0.0012927869790617196. Divide by 2 again: 0.0006463934895308598.  Check rounding to 15 significant digits. The result has many digits. Let's present maybe 0.00064639348953086 (rounded to 15 significant digits). Count significant digits: ignoring leading zeros, first non-zero digit is 6 at 4th decimal place after 0.000. So we need 15 significant digits total.  Our number: 0.0006463934895308598  Significant digits: 6 4 6 3 9 3 4 8 9 5 3 0 8 5 9 8 ... that's 16 digits. Need at most 15. So round to 15 digits: take first 15 digits: 6 4 6 3 9 3 4 8 9 5 3 0 8 5 9 . Next digit is 8 (16th) which would round up the 15th digit (9) to 10 causing carry. Let's see.  Digits list: 1:6,2:4,3:6,4:3,5:9,6:3,7:4,8:8,9:9,10:5,11:3,12:0,13:8,14:5,15:9,16:8,17:?  We need to round to 15 significant digits. The 15th digit is 9, next digit is 8 which is >=5, so we round up. 9 becomes 10, carry to previous digit.  So we need to add 1 to the 14th digit (5). 5 becomes 6, and 15th digit becomes 0. So the rounded 15-digit sequence becomes: digits up to 14: 6 4 6 3 9 3 4 8 9 5 3 0 8 6, then 0 for 15th? Wait after rounding, we have 14th digit increased to 6, and 15th digit becomes 0. So the number becomes 0.00064639348953086? Let's verify.  Original digits: 0.000 6463934895308598  Write as 0.00064639348953086 after rounding to 15 sig figs? Let's count: after decimal, we have leading zeros 3 zeros then digits.  Significant digits start at 6 (the first non-zero). So we need 15 digits after that.  Our rounded number: 0.00064639348953086  Now count significant digits: digits after leading zeros: 6 4 6 3 9 3 4 8 9 5 3 0 8 6 -> that's 14? Wait count: 1:6,2:4,3:6,4:3,5:9,6:3,7:4,8:8,9:9,10:5,11:3,12:0,13:8,14:6. That's 14 digits. Need 15. Did we lose one? Let's recount original digits: 0.0006463934895308598  Digits after leading zeros: 6 4 6 3 9 3 4 8 9 5 3 0 8 5 9 8 (16 digits). We rounded to 15 digits, so we should have 15 digits after leading zeros.  Our rounding gave 0.00064639348953086 (14 digits). Something off.  Let's compute rounding properly: Keep 15 significant digits.  Take first 15 digits: positions:  1 6 2 4 3 6 4 3 5 9 6 3 7 4 8 8 9 9 10 5 11 3 12 0 13 8 14 5 15 9  Next digit (16) is 8.  So we need to round the 15th digit (9) up because next digit 8 >=5. So 9 becomes 10, carry to 14th digit (5) becomes 6, and 15th digit becomes 0.  Thus the rounded sequence of 15 digits becomes:  Digits 1-13 unchanged: 6 4 6 3 9 3 4 8 9 5 3 0 8  Digit 14 becomes 6 (was 5+1)  Digit 15 becomes 0  Thus the 15-digit number is: 6 4 6 3 9 3 4 8 9 5 3 0 8 6 0  Now write as decimal: 0.000646393489530860  But trailing zero may be omitted. So 0.00064639348953086 (which has 14 significant digits? Actually after removing trailing zero, we have 14 digits, but the zero is significant if we intend 15 digits. However we can present as 0.00064639348953086 (that's 14 sig figs). To keep 15, we could write 0.000646393489530860 (15 sig figs). The instruction: ""rounded to at most 15 significant digits."" So we can give fewer, that's okay. So 0.00064639348953086 is acceptable (14 sig figs). Good.  Thus answer.",3712,237,3949,,,2343,,0,0,192,0.00226275,False,,3.555e-05,0.0022272

Now sum deviations: 7.2e-13 -3.93e-12 -3e-14 +4.07e-12 +6.68e-12.  Compute: start 7.2e-13 = 0.72e-12.  Add -3.93e-12 => -3.21e-12 (0.72-3.93 = -3.21).  Add -0.03e-12 (since -3e-14 = -0.03e-12) => -3.24e-12.  Add +4.07e-12 => 0.83e-12.  Add +6.68e-12 => 7.51e-12.  So total deviation sum ≈ 7.51e-12.

That's 16 digits maybe. Let's count significant digits: 816.27267293556096 has 18 digits (including before decimal). Need at most 15 significant digits. So we need to round to 15 significant digits.  Significant digits start from first non-zero: 8 1 6 . 2 7 2 6 7 2 9 3 5 5 6 0 9 6  We need 15 digits total. Count:  1:8 2:1 3:6 4:2 (first after decimal) 5:7 6:2 7:6 8:7 9:2 10:9 11:3 12:5 13:5 14:6 15:0  So we keep up to the 0 after 6? Actually the 15th digit is the 0 after 6 (the digit before 9). So we round at that position. The next digit (16th) is 9, which would round up. So we need to round the 15th digit (0) up by 1, making it 1, and truncate after that.  Thus the rounded number becomes: digits up to 15: 816.272672935560? Wait we need to reconstruct.  Let's write the number with full digits: 816.27267293556096  Write without decimal: 81627267293556096 (but decimal after 3 digits). Let's list digits:  816 . 27267293556096  After decimal: 2 7 2 6 7 2 9 3 5 5 6 0 9 6  Count total significant digits: before decimal we have 3 digits (816). So we need 12 more after decimal to reach 15 total.  Thus we need to keep 12 decimal places.  Let's take first 12 decimal digits: 272672935560  Now the 13th decimal digit is 9 (since after those 12 digits, the next is 9). So we round the 12th digit (0) up by 1 => becomes 1, and trailing digits removed.  Thus decimal part becomes 272672935561 (since 0 becomes 1). Need to handle carry if 9? No, 0+1=1.  Thus final rounded value: 816.272672935561  Check significance: 3 integer digits + 12 decimal = 15 significant digits.

Now divide by 5: 24,061,993,844.41397 / 5 = 4,812,398,768.882794? Let's compute: 24,061,993,844.41397 / 5 = 4,812,398,768.882794. Because 5*4,812,398,768 = 24,061,993,840. Then remainder .882794*5 = 4.41397, matches. So answer 4812398768.882794.  Check rounding to at most 15 significant digits. This has 13 digits before decimal plus 6 after = 19 total, but significant digits count includes all non-leading zeros. We can give as 4812398768.882794 (that's 16 significant digits? Let's count: digits: 4 8 1 2 3 9 8 7 6 8 (10 digits before decimal) then after decimal 8 8 2 7 9 4 (6 digits) total 16 significant digits. Need at most 15. Could round to 15 significant digits. Let's round to 15 significant digits.  We have number: 4,812,398,768.882794.  Significant digits: start from first non-zero digit 4. Need 15 digits total.  Digits: 1:4,2:8,3:1,4:2,5:3,6:9,7:8,8:7,9:6,10:8, decimal point not count, then 11:8,12:8,13:2,14:7,15:9, then next digit 4 for rounding.  So we keep up to digit 15 = the '9' (the fifth decimal place). Next digit is 4, so round down. So result: 4,812,398,768.88279? Wait we need 15 significant digits: we have 10 integer digits, need 5 decimal digits to reach 15. So keep 5 decimal places: .88279 (since rounding). The next digit is 4 (the sixth decimal place), so .88279 stays.  Thus answer: 4812398768.88279.  Check: that's 15 significant digits (10+5). Good.

Let's compute precisely.  8765717540.060717 -3304848196.6401286 = 5460869343.4205884 (yes)  Now add third: -39130535.16988611.  5460869343.4205884 - 39130535.16988611 = 5421738808.250702? Compute:  5460869343.4205884 - 39,130,535.16988611 = 5421738808.2507023 (since 5460869343.4205884 - 39,130,535 = 5421738808.4205884, then subtract .16988611 gives 5421738808.2507023). Good.  Now add fourth: -5,365,889,494.594624.  5421738808.2507023 - 5,365,889,494.594624 = -? Compute:  5,421,738,808.2507023 - 5,365,889,494.594624 = 55,849,313.6560783? Wait sign: 5,421,738,808 - 5,365,889,494 = 55,849,314 approx. Since we have 5,421,738,808.2507023 - 5,365,889,494.594624 = 55,849,313.6560783. So result is positive? Actually we subtract a larger number? Let's check: 5,421,738,808 is larger than 5,365,889,494, so difference positive. So sum = 55,849,313.6560783.  Thus total sum = 55,849,313.6560783.  Now mean = sum / 4 = 13,962,328.414019575? Compute: 55,849,313.6560783 / 4 = 13,962,328.414019575.  Let's compute precisely: 55,849,313.6560783 / 2 = 27,924,656.82803915. Divide by 2 again = 13,962,328.414019575.  Thus answer.  Round to at most 15 significant digits. The number has 14 digits before decimal?

That's 16 significant digits (including integer part). Need at most 15. Could round to 15 significant digits: 3.25061061072329?

Actually after decimal: .250610610723288 Sequence after decimal: 2,5,0,6,1,0,6,1,0,7,2,3,2,8,8 So 15th decimal digit is the second 8?

The next digit (16th) does not exist? Actually we have only 15 decimal digits after decimal? We have 15 decimal digits, plus integer digit makes 16 significant digits. So to round to 15 significant digits, we need to drop one digit (the last 8). So we keep 15 significant digits total: that would be 3.25061061072328? Let's count: 3 (1), .2 (2),5(3),0(4),6(5),1(6),0(7),6(8),1(9),0(10),7(11),2(12),3(13),2(14),8(15). So 3.25061061072328 (15 sig digits). The next digit (the 16th) is 8, which would round up the last digit (8) to 9? Actually we are truncating after the 15th digit which is the 8 at position 14? Wait confusion.  Let's just produce answer with sufficient precision, maybe 3.25061061072329 is okay (16 sig digits). The instruction: at most 15 significant digits. So we must not exceed 15. Provide 3.25061061072328 (15 sig digits). That is rounding down? Since next digit is 8, rounding up would make last digit 9: 3.25061061072329. That would be 15 sig digits? Let's count: 3.25061061072329 digits: integer 3 (1), decimal digits: 2,5,0,6,1,0,6,1,0,7,2,3,2,9 = 14 decimal digits, total 15. Yes because we replaced last 8 with 9, still 15 sig digits.

Now add 3: 0.03454911929748483 0.06909810475215522 + 0.03454911929748483 = 0.10364722404964005 (since 0.06909810475215522+0.03454911929748483 = 0.10364722404964005).  Now add 4: 0.034549028908313295 0.10364722404964005 + 0.034549028908313295 = 0.13819625295795335.  Now divide by 4: 0.13819625295795335 / 4 = 0.0345490632394883375.  Compute: 0.13819625295795335 / 2 = 0.06909812647897668; divide by 2 again = 0.03454906323948834.  So mean ≈ 0.03454906323948834.  Round to at most 15 significant digits. Let's count: 0.03454906323948834 has leading zeros not counted. Significant digits start at 3. Digits: 3 4 5 4 9 0 6 3 2 3 9 4 8 8 3 4 = 16 digits? Let's count: after decimal: 03454906323948834. Leading zero after decimal not significant? Actually significant digits start at first non-zero digit: 3. So digits: 3,4,5,4,9,0,6,3,2,3,9,4,8,8,3,4 = 16. Need at most 15. So we can round to 15 significant digits.  Take 15 significant digits: we need to round at 15th digit.  List digits: 1:3,2:4,3:5,4:4,5:9,6:0,7:6,8:3,9:2,10:3,11:9,12:4,13:8,14:8,15:3,16:4.  15th digit is 3, next digit (16th) is 4 (<5) so keep 3. So 15-digit number: 0.0345490632394883? Wait we need 15 significant digits total. Let's construct: 0.0345490632394883 (that's 16? Let's count after decimal ignoring leading zero: digits after decimal: 0 3 4 5 4 9 0 6 3 2 3 9 4 8 8 3. But the first digit after decimal is 0 which is not significant because leading zeros after decimal before first non-zero are not significant. So significant digits start at the 3 (second decimal place). So we need 15 digits starting from that 3.  Write number: 0.03454906323948834.  Significant digits: positions: 1:3 (tenths? actually hundredths) 2:4 3:5 4:4 5:9 6:0 7:6 8:3 9:2 10:3 11:9 12:4 13:8 14:8 15:3 16:4  We need 15 digits, so drop last digit (4) rounding based on it. Since it's 4, we keep 3. So result: 0.0345490632394883.  Check that this has 15 significant digits: digits after decimal: 0 3 4 5 4 9 0 6 3 2 3 9 4 8 8 3. The leading zero after decimal is not significant, so we have 15 digits from 3 onward: 3,4,5,4,9,0,6,3,2,3,9,4,8,8,3 = 15. Good.

So sum deviations = 8.26e-10 = 0.000000000826.  Now average deviation = sum/4 = 0.000000000826 /4 = 0.0000000002065 = 2.065e-10.  Add to base: 8135.171218195 + 2.065e-10 = 8135.1712181950002065? Actually base had .195000. So final mean = 8135.1712181952065? Wait need correct decimal places.  Base = 8135.171218195000 (since we used 8135.171218195). Add 2.065e-10 = 0.0000000002065.  Thus mean = 8135.1712181952065.  Check rounding to appropriate precision (15 significant digits). Number is about 4 digits before decimal, total significant digits 15 => need about 11 decimal places? Actually 8135 has 4 digits, so need 11 more digits after decimal to reach 15 significant digits. Our result has many decimal places. Let's round to 11 decimal places after decimal? 15 significant digits total: digits: 8,1,3,5 =4, then decimal digits count until total 15. So need 11 decimal digits. Let's compute mean to 11 decimal places.  Our mean: 8135.1712181952065.  Take 11 decimal places: after decimal we have .17121819520... Let's list digits:  Decimal part: 1 7 1 2 1 8 1 9 5 2 0 6 5 ...  Count: 1(1),7(2),1(3),2(4),1(5),8(6),1(7),9(8),5(9),2(10),0(11),6(12)...  So 11 decimal digits = 17121819520. Next digit (12th) is 6, so round up the 11th digit (0) to 1. So result = 8135.17121819521.  Check rounding: 11th digit currently 0, next digit 6 >=5, so increment to 1. So decimal becomes ...19521.  Thus answer 8135.17121819521.

So 12959.4713485 = 12960 - 0.5286515. Divide: 12960/3 = 4320. 0.5286515/3 = 0.176217166666... So result = 4320 - 0.176217166666... = 4320 - 0.176217166666 = 4319.823782833334.  Let's compute more precisely: 0.5286515 /3 = 0.1762171666666667. Subtract from 4320 gives 4319.8237828333333.  Thus mean ≈ 4319.82378283333.  Round to at most 15 significant digits. That's 4319.82378283333 (14 digits?). Let's count: digits excluding decimal: 4,3,1,9 = 4 digits before decimal, then after decimal we have 13 digits maybe. Total significant digits = all non-leading zeros. So we can give 4319.82378283333 (14 significant digits). That's fine.

Let's compute precisely:  366475.65714 +366475.66636 =732951.32350 (since .65714 + .66636 = 1.3235, carry 1 to integer part: 366475+366475+1 = 732951). Yes sum = 732951.3235.  Now add third: 366475.66357.  732951.3235 + 366475.66357 = 1,099,426.98707? Let's compute:  732,951.32350 +366,475.66357 =1,099,426.98707.  Check decimal: .32350 + .66357 = .98707, no carry.

Actually 366,475 *3 = 1,099,425. Subtract from sum: 1,099,426.98707 - 1,099,425 = 1.98707.  Now divide remainder 1.98707 by 3 = 0.662356666... Actually 1.98707/3 = 0.662356666666... Let's compute precisely: 1.98707 /3 = 0.6623566666666667 (since 1.98707 = 1.98707). So mean = 366,475 + 0.6623566666667 = 366,475.6623566667.  But we need rounding to at most 15 significant digits. Let's compute more precisely using decimal addition maybe rounding errors.  Let's compute sum more precisely using high precision:  Numbers: A = 366475.65714 B = 366475.66636 C = 366475.66357  Add A+B:  366475.65714 +366475.66636 =732951.32350 (as earlier). Good.  Add C: 732951.32350 + 366475.66357 = 1,099,426.98707. Good.  Now divide by 3.  We can do long division: 1,099,426.98707 /3.  3 goes into 1,099,426 = 366,475 remainder 1 (since 366,475*3 = 1,099,425). Remainder = 1,426? Wait we need to handle decimal.  Actually 1,099,426 - 1,099,425 = 1. So after integer part 366,475, remainder = 1. Then bring down decimal .98707.  So we have 1.98707 /3 = 0.662356666666... So final = 366,475.6623566667 approx.  Let's compute more digits: 1.98707 /3 = 0.6623566666666667 (since 0.662356666... *3 = 1.98707). Let's verify: 0.6623566666666667 *3 = 1.98707? Multiply: 0.6623566666666667*3 = 1.98707 exactly? 0.6623566666666667*3 = 1.98707 (since 0.6623566666666667*3 = 1.98707). Good.  Thus mean = 366475.6623566667.  We can round to maybe 15 significant digits: The number has 6 digits before decimal, so we can have up to 9 decimal places to keep 15 significant digits. Currently we have 13 decimal digits? Actually we have 13 after decimal? Let's count: 366475.6623566667 has 13 decimal digits? Let's count: .6623566667 = 10 decimal digits. That's fine.  Significant digits: total digits ignoring decimal point: 6 (integer part) + decimal digits until we reach 15 total. So we can give 9 decimal places (6+9=15). We have 10 decimal places, that's okay but we can keep up to 15. Provide maybe 366475.662356667 (rounded to 12 decimal places). Let's round to 15 significant digits: we have 6 integer digits, need 9 more digits. So take first 9 decimal digits: .662356666. The 10th digit is 7, so round up the 9th digit (the last 6) by 1? The 9th digit is the 9th decimal place: let's list decimal digits: 6 6 2 3 5 6 6 6 6 7 ... Actually decimal expansion: .6623566667... digits: 1:6,2:6,3:2,4:3,5:5,6:6,7:6,8:6,9:6,10:7,...  So first 9 digits: 662356666. The 10th digit is 7, so round up the 9th digit (which is 6) to 7, making .662356667. So final 15 significant digits: 366475.662356667.  Thus answer.

Round to at most  significant digits. The number has 16 digits maybe. Let's count significant digits: 2378.1615252099568 has 16 digits (excluding decimal point). Need at most 15. Could round to 15 significant digits: Let's get 15 significant digits: Starting from first non-zero: 2 3 7 8 . 1 6 1 5 2 5 2 0 9 9? Let's count: digits: 2(1),3(2),7(3),8(4),1(5),6(6),1(7),5(8),2(9),5(10),2(11),0(12),9(13),9(14),5(15),6(16),8(17). Need 15 significant digits, so keep up to the 15th digit: that is the digit '5' at position 15. Let's list digits with positions:  1:2 2:3 3:7 4:8 5:1 (first after decimal) 6:6 7:1 8:5 9:2 10:5 11:2 12:0 13:9 14:9 15:5 16:6 17:8  So we keep up to digit 15 = 5. Next digit (16) is 6, so round up. So we need to round the 15th digit (5) up by 1 because next digit >=5. So 5 becomes 6, and trailing digits removed. So the rounded number becomes with digits up to 15: 2378.1615252096? Wait need to adjust.  Let's write the number with full digits: 2378.1615252099568  Write as sequence: 2 3 7 8 . 1 6 1 5 2 5 2 0 9 9 5 6 8  Positions after decimal: 1:1,2:6,3:1,4:5,5:2,6:5,7:2,8:0,9:9,10:9,11:5,12:6,13:8  But we counted overall significant digits including integer part. So 4 integer digits + decimal digits.  We need 15 significant digits total. So we need 15 - 4 = 11 decimal digits.  Thus keep 11 decimal places.  Let's take 11 decimal digits after decimal: decimal digits list: 1)1,2)6,3)1,4)5,5)2,6)5,7)2,8)0,9)9,10)9,11)5,12)6,13)8  Take first 11: 1 6 1 5 2 5 2 0 9 9 5  So number = 2378.16152520995  Now look at the 12th decimal digit (which is 6) to round. Since 6 >=5, we round up the last kept digit (the 11th decimal digit) which is 5, to 6. So decimal becomes ... after rounding: 2378.16152520996? Wait need to add 1 to the last digit (5) making it 6, no carry beyond.  Thus final rounded to 11 decimal places: 2378.16152520996  Check if any trailing zeros not needed. That's 15 significant digits: 4 integer + 11 decimal = 15.  Thus answer.",1273.0,238.0,1511.0,,,844.0,,0.0,0.0,160.0,0.0007995,False,,3.57e-05,0.0007638

Actually significant digits count all digits starting from first non-zero. Here integer part has 9 digits, decimal part we have 7 digits after decimal (maybe 7). Total 16. Limit is at most 15. So we may need to round to 15 significant digits.  Let's count: integer part 9 digits. So we can have up to 6 decimal digits to stay within 15 total. So we need to round to 6 decimal places.

So integer part: 171,103,862 + 85,551,931 = 256,655,793, plus carry 1 = 256,655,794. Decimal .32397397. Yes.  Now mean = sum / 3 = 256,655,794.32397397 / 3.  Compute: 256,655,794 /3 = 85,551,931.333... but need precise.  Let's do division: 256,655,794.32397397 ÷ 3.  3 * 85,551,931 = 256,655,793. So remainder 1.32397397.  Now 1.32397397 /3 = 0.441324656666... Actually 1.32397397 /3 = 0.4413246566666667.  Add to 85,551,931 => 85,551,931.4413246566667.  Now we need rounding to at most 15 significant digits. The original numbers have 17 digits? Let's produce answer with appropriate precision: 85551931.44132466? Let's see rounding.  Our computed mean: 85,551,931.4413246566667.  Significant digits: starting from first non-zero digit 8. Need up to 15 significant digits. Count digits: 8 5 5 5 1 9 3 1 . 4 4 1 3 2 4 6 5 6... That's 8 digits before decimal, so we can have 7 after decimal to make total 15. So we need 7 decimal places after decimal? Actually 8 integer digits, need total 15 => 7 decimal digits.  So round to 7 decimal places: 85,551,931.4413247? Let's round the 8th decimal digit.  Our value: 85,551,931.4413246566667  Decimal part: 4413246566667...  Take 7 decimal places: 4413246. Next digit (8th) is 5 (since after 4413246 we have 5). So round up: 4413246 + 1 = 4413247.  Thus result: 85551931.4413247.  Check if rounding correct: 7 decimal digits after decimal: .4413247.

Let's just write the 13-digit string: ""0036862905988"". Let's index:  1: 0 2: 0 3: 3 4: 6 5: 8 6: 6 7: 2 8: 9 9: 0 10: 5 11: 9 12: 8 13: 8  But that's 13 digits, but we need to ensure correct order. Actually the string ""0036862905988"": characters:  1 '0' 2 '0' 3 '3' 4 '6' 5 '8' 6 '6' 7 '2' 8 '9' 9 '0' 10 '5' 11 '9' 12 '8' 13 '8'  Similarly for others.  Let's write all four numbers as strings:  A = 0 0 3 6 8 6 2 9 0 5 9 8 8 B = 0 0 3 6 8 6 2 9 0 5 9 7 6 C = 0 0 3 6 8 6 2 9 0 5 9 8 3 D = 0 0 3 6 8 6 2 9 0 5 9 7 4  Now sum columnwise from rightmost (position 13) to leftmost (position1).  Initialize carry =0.  Pos13 (rightmost): digits: A13=8, B13=6, C13=3, D13=4. Sum =8+6+3+4=21. Write digit =1, carry=2.  Pos12: digits: A12=8, B12=7, C12=8, D12=7. Sum =8+7+8+7=30 plus carry 2 =32.

Now the resulting sum digits from pos1 to pos13: 0 1 4 7 4 5 1 6 2 3 9 2 1? Wait we need to list in order.  Let's write positions with resulting digit:  Pos1:0 Pos2:1 Pos3:4 Pos4:7 Pos5:4 Pos6:5 Pos7:1 Pos8:6 Pos9:2 Pos10:3 Pos11:9 Pos12:2 Pos13:1  Thus sum integer = 0147451623921? Actually combine: 0 1 4 7 4 5 1 6 2 3 9 2 1 => ""0147451623921"". Leading zero can be omitted: 147451623921? Wait count digits: we have 13 digits, but leading zero removed gives 12 digits? Let's check: original numbers each 13 digits, sum of four numbers could be up to 14 digits. Our result has leading zero, so effective 13 digits maybe starting with 1? Actually we have 0 at most significant, then 1 at next. So the number is 0 1 4 7 4 5 1 6 2 3 9 2 1 = 0147451623921. That's 13 digits, but leading zero not needed, so 147451623921? That's 12 digits. Let's verify length: 147,451,623,921 is 12 digits. But we expect sum of four numbers each around 3.686e-3 *10^13 = 3.686e10? Wait each integer is about 3.686e9? Actually 0.003686... times 10^13 = 3.686e10? Let's compute: 0.003686... * 10^13 = 3.686e10 (since 10^13 * 0.003 = 3e10). So each integer around 3.686e10, sum of four ~1.474e11, which matches 147,451,623,921 (1.474e11). Good.  Now we have sum integer = 147,451,623,921.  Now to get mean, divide by 4, then divide by 10^13 to get back decimal.  First compute average integer = sum /4 = 147,451,623,921 /4 = ?  Divide: 147,451,623,921 ÷ 4 = 36,862,905,980.25? Let's compute.  4 * 36,862,905,980 = 147,451,623,920. Remainder 1. So quotient = 36,862,905,980 remainder 1. So decimal = 36,862,905,980.25? Wait remainder 1 means 1/4 = 0.25. So average integer = 36,862,905,980.25.  Thus mean = (average integer) / 10^13 = 36,862,905,980.25 / 10^13 = 3.686290598025e-3? Let's compute: 36,862,905,980.25 / 10,000,000,000,000 = 0.003686290598025.  Check digits: 36,862,905,980.25 / 10^13 = 0.003686290598025.  Now round to appropriate significant digits (up to 15). Provide decimal.  Thus answer 0.003686290598025.  Let's ensure rounding: original numbers have 13 decimal places. Mean may have up to 13 decimal places, but we have 15 significant digits allowed. Our result has 15 decimal digits after decimal? Actually 0.003686290598025 has 15 decimal digits after decimal? Count: after decimal: 003686290598025 -> that's 15 digits. That's fine.

Actually mean = (sum of original) /4 = (sum of scaled)/4 *1e-5.  So compute average of scaled numbers: 5.406873062077357 /4 = 1.35171826551933925 (since 5.406873062077357 /2 = 2.7034365310386785, then /2 again = 1.35171826551933925). Good.

Our computed value: 0.0008852856983385212.  15 significant digits: count digits after leading zeros: digits: 8 8 5 2 8 5 6 9 8 3 3 8 5 2 1 2? That's 16? Let's count: 8(1),8(2),5(3),2(4),8(5),5(6),6(7),9(8),8(9),3(10),3(11),8(12),5(13),2(14),1(15),2(16). So 16 digits. Need at most 15, so round to 15 digits.  Take first 15 digits: 8 8 5 2 8 5 6 9 8 3 3 8 5 2 1. Next digit is 2 (16th) which is less than 5, so keep.  Thus number = 0.000885285698338521? Wait we need to place decimal correctly.  Our value: 0.0008852856983385212.  Write with 15 significant digits: 0.00088528569833852? Let's see: after leading zeros, we need 15 digits. The digits after decimal start: 0 0 0 8 8 5 2 8 5 6 9 8 3 3 8 5 2 1 2. Leading zeros not counted. So first non-zero digit is 8 at 4th decimal place. So we need 15 digits starting from that 8.  Our digits: 8 8 5 2 8 5 6 9 8 3 3 8 5 2 1 2.  Take first 15: 8 8 5 2 8 5 6 9 8 3 3 8 5 2 1. That's 15 digits. So number = 0.000885285698338521? Wait we need to place decimal after leading zeros: 0.000 (three zeros) then digits.  Thus 0.000885285698338521 (since we have 15 digits after the leading zeros). That matches rounding (next digit 2 less than 5). So final answer.  Return JSON.",994,237,1231,,,674,,0,0,160,0.00063195,False,,3.555e-05,0.0005964

Let's compute:  9128.86134251210 +4564.430728516191 =13693.292071028291 (since 9128+4564=13692, decimal .86134251210 + .430728516191 = 1.292071028291, carry 1 to integer: 13692+1=13693, decimal .292071028291).

So total = 4564 + 0.430664566593 = 4564.430664566593.  Check more precisely: Let's do division.  22822.153322832965 /5.  5 goes into 22 -> 4 remainder 2. Actually compute using decimal: 5*4564 = 22820. Subtract from sum: remainder = 2.153322832965.  Divide remainder by 5: 2.153322832965 /5 = 0.430664566593.  Add to 4564 => 4564.430664566593.  Thus answer.  Round to at most 15 significant digits. The number has 16 digits maybe. Let's count significant digits: 4564.430664566593 has 16 digits (excluding decimal point). We need at most 15. Could round to 15 significant digits: Let's count from first non-zero: 4 5 6 4 . 4 3 0 6 6 4 5 6 6 5 9 3? Actually digits: 4,5,6,4,4,3,0,6,6,4,5,6,6,5,9,3. That's 16. Need 15. So we drop last digit maybe round.  Take first 15 digits: 4564.43066456659? Let's see: Write number with full: 4564.430664566593.  Significant digits: ignoring decimal point, start at 4 (the first digit). Count 15 digits:  1:4 2:5 3:6 4:4 5:4 6:3 7:0 8:6 9:6 10:4 11:5 12:6 13:6 14:5 15:9  So up to digit 15 is the '9' (the second to last). The next digit is 3, which would round the 9? Actually rounding at 15 digits: we look at the 16th digit (3) to decide rounding of 15th digit (9). Since 3 <5, we keep 9. So result with 15 significant digits: 4564.43066456659?

Yes.  Now mean = sum / 5 = -62,190.122546444 / 5 = -12,438.0245092888? Let's compute.  62,190.122546444 /5 = 12,438.0245092888 (since 60,000/5=12,000; 2,190.122546444/5=438.0245092888).

Count digits ignoring sign and decimal point: 5 digits before decimal (12438) plus after decimal we need total 15 significant digits => need 10 after decimal. We have 13 after decimal. So we can round to 10 decimal places: 12438.0245092888 -> first 10 digits after decimal: 0245092888, next digit is? after that we have 8?

Actually we need to verify the exact decimal we computed: -12,438.0245092888. Let's compute more precisely division: 62,190.122546444 /5.  5 * 12,438 = 62,190. So remainder 0.122546444. Divide remainder by 5 = 0.0245092888. Yes because 0.122546444 /5 = 0.0245092888. So exact decimal is -12,438.0245092888 (finite). So we have 4 decimal places? Actually 0.0245092888 has 10 decimal digits. So total decimal digits after point = 10. So total significant digits = digits before decimal (5) + after decimal (10) = 15. Good.

We'll treat as high precision.  Let's compute using high precision manually.  I'll align to 16 decimal places maybe.  Write each number with 16 decimal places:  1: 1296.0302683979946 2: 1296.0302683979596 3: 1296.0302683979000 (pad zeros) 4: 1296.0302683980121 5: 1296.0302683979320  Now sum.  Add them column wise.  Let's sum the fractional part after decimal (the part .030268...).  But easier: sum all numbers.  We can sum integer part: each has 1296, five times = 6480.  Now sum fractional parts:  1: 0.0302683979946 2: 0.0302683979596 3: 0.0302683979000 4: 0.0302683980121 5: 0.0302683979320  Now sum these five fractions.  Let's add them.  I'll add stepwise.  First add 1 and 2:  0.0302683979946 +0.0302683979596 =0.0605367959542  Add 3:  0.0605367959542 +0.0302683979000 =0.0908051938542  Add 4:  0.0908051938542 +0.0302683980121 =0.1210735918663  Add 5:  0.1210735918663 +0.0302683979320 =0.1513419897983  So total fractional sum = 0.1513419897983  Now total sum = 6480 + 0.1513419897983 = 6480.1513419897983  Now mean = total /5 = 6480.1513419897983 /5  Compute: 6480 /5 = 1296.0  0.1513419897983 /5 = 0.03026839795966? Let's compute precisely.  0.1513419897983 ÷5 = 0.03026839795966 (since 0.1513419897983 *0.2). Multiply 0.1513419897983 *0.2 = 0.03026839795966.  Now add to 1296.0 gives 1296.03026839795966.  Thus mean = 1296.0302683979597 (rounded to 15 significant digits). Let's see significant digits: number is about 1.296e3, 15 significant digits means total digits not counting leading zeros. Provide maybe 1296.03026839796 (14? Let's count). Let's produce 15 significant digits.  Write number: 1296.03026839795966  Count significant digits: all digits except leading zeros. Starting from 1: digits: 1,2,9,6,0,3,0,2,6,8,3,9,7,9,5,9,6,6. That's 18 digits. Need at most 15. So we need round to 15 significant digits.  Take first 15 digits: 1 2 9 6 0 3 0 2 6 8 3 9 7 9 5  That's 1296.03026839795? Wait need to place decimal correctly.  Number: 1296.03026839795966  Write as 1 2 9 6 . 0 3 0 2 6 8 3 9 7 9 5 9 6 6  Significant digits start at 1. So first 15 significant digits: 1 2 9 6 0 3 0 2 6 8 3 9 7 9 5  Thus we keep up to the digit 5 (the 15th). That corresponds to ... after decimal: we have digits after decimal: 0 3 0 2 6 8 3 9 7 9 5 ... So we need to round based on next digit (the 16th significant digit) which is 9 (the next after 5). Since next digit 9 >=5, we round up the 15th digit (5) to 6.  Thus result becomes 1296.03026839796 (since we round the last kept digit from 5 to 6). Let's verify digits: after decimal we have 0 3 0 2 6 8 3 9 7 9 6? Wait we need to ensure correct rounding.  Let's write full number with grouping:  1296.03026839795966  After decimal: 0 3 0 2 6 8 3 9 7 9 5 9 6 6  Indices: 1:0 2:3 3:0 4:2 5:6 6:8 7:3 8:9 9:7 10:9 11:5 12:9 13:6 14:6  Now significant digits include integer part digits 1,2,9,6 (4 digits) then decimal digits continue.  We need total 15 significant digits. Already have 4 integer digits, need 11 decimal digits to reach 15.  So we need first 11 decimal digits after decimal.  Decimal digits list: 0(1),3(2),0(3),2(4),6(5),8(6),3(7),9(8),7(9),9(10),5(11),9(12)...  So first 11 decimal digits are: 0 3 0 2 6 8 3 9 7 9 5  Thus number rounded to 11 decimal places: 1296.03026839795  Now look at the 12th decimal digit (which is 9) to round. Since 9 >=5, we round up the 11th decimal digit (5) to 6, giving 1296.03026839796.  Thus final answer with 15 significant digits: 1296.03026839796 (that's 4 integer + 11 decimal = 15 digits). Good.

Let's see: 9.774534215808075, 15 significant digits: first digit 9 counts as 1, then decimal digits count. So need total 15 digits. Count: digits: 9 (1), then decimal digits: 7(2),7(3),4(4),5(5),3(6),4(7),2(8),1(9),5(10),8(11),0(12),8(13),0(14),7(15),5(16). So we need 15 digits, drop last digit (5) rounding.

But better compute using high precision: Let's just compute using arithmetic.  Take sum = 63,676,612.17795618.  Divide by 3:  63,676,612 ÷3 = 21,225,537 remainder 1 (since 21,225,537*3 = 63,676,611). So remainder 1.17795618.  Now 1.17795618 /3 = 0.39265206.  Add to 21,225,537 gives 21,225,537.39265206.  Check rounding to 15 significant digits. The number has 8 digits before decimal, so we can have up to 7 after decimal to reach 15 significant digits. But we can give full as needed.  Our computed decimal maybe need more precision: Let's verify sum more precisely.  Add numbers precisely:  Number1: 21225537.39264274 Number2: 21225537.39265805 Number3: 21225537.39265539  Add the integer parts: 21,225,537 *3 = 63,676,611.  Add fractional parts:  0.39264274 +0.39265805 +0.39265539 = ?  Add first two: 0.39264274 + 0.39265805 = 0.78530079.  Add third: 0.78530079 + 0.39265539 = 1.17795618.  Thus total sum = 63,676,611 + 1.17795618 = 63,676,612.17795618. matches earlier.  Now divide by 3: integer part 21,225,537 remainder 1.17795618.  Now 1.17795618 /3 = 0.39265206 exactly? Let's compute: 1.17795618 ÷3.  3 * 0.39265206 = 1.17795618? Multiply: 0.39265206 *3 = 1.17795618 exactly (since 0.39265206*3 = 1.17795618). So it's exact to 8 decimal places given the fraction.  Thus mean = 21,225,537.39265206.  Check if any rounding needed: we have 8 decimal places. That's fine.  Return JSON.",1014.0,220.0,1234.0,,,789.0,,0.0,0.0,192.0,0.0006414,False,,3.3e-05,0.0006084

Significant digits count from first non-zero. So we have 14 integer digits, we can include decimal up to total 15? Actually at most 15 significant digits, so we can give full precision maybe 15 total digits. Our number: 66657000136.97950725 has 14 integer digits (since 66,657,000,136 is 11? Wait count: 66,657,000,136 is 11? Let's count: 66,657,000,136 -> digits: 66 (2) then 657 (3) total 5, then 000 (3) total 8, then 136 (3) total 11. Actually 66,657,000,136 is 11 digits. Wait earlier we thought 14. Let's recount: 66,657,000,136 is 11 digits. Indeed 10^10 is 10,000,000,000 (11 digits). So 66 billion is 11 digits. So integer part has 11 digits. So we can have up to 15 significant digits, meaning we can include up to 4 decimal digits. But we can give more as long as not exceed 15? The instruction: ""rounded to at most 15 significant digits."" So we can give up to 15 significant digits. Our number currently has 11 integer digits + 8 decimal digits = 19 significant digits, too many. Need to round to 15 significant digits.  We need to round to 15 significant digits total.  Take number: 66,657,000,136.97950725  Write without commas: 66657000136.97950725  Count digits from first non-zero: first digit 6 is digit 1. So we need 15 digits total.  Let's list digits:  1:6 2:6 3:6 4:5 5:7 6:0 7:0 8:0 9:1 10:3 11:6 12: . (decimal not counted) After decimal: 13:9 14:7 15:9 16:5 17:0 18:7 19:2 20:5  We need 15 significant digits, so we keep up to digit 15 (which is the third decimal digit after decimal? Let's see: digits 1-11 are integer part (since integer part has 11 digits). So digits 12-? after decimal. Actually integer part digits count: 66657000136 -> that's 11 digits. So digits 1-11 are those. Then digit 12 is first decimal digit 9, digit13 is 7, digit14 is 9, digit15 is 5. So we keep up to digit 15 which is the fourth decimal digit (since decimal digits start at 9). So we need to round at the fourth decimal place (i.e., 5th decimal digit). The number after decimal: .9795 0725... So we keep .9795 and look at next digit (0) to round. Since next digit is 0 (<5), we keep .9795.  Thus rounded number: 66657000136.9795  Check significant digits: integer part 11 digits + 4 decimal = 15 digits. Good.

Wait need to place decimal correctly.  Original number: 6193.036107033667  Write digits: 6 1 9 3 . 0 3 6 1 0 7 0 3 3 6 6 7  We need 15 significant digits total, counting from first 6. So we need 15 digits including those before decimal and after. There are 4 digits before decimal (6193). So we need 11 digits after decimal to make total 15. Let's take 11 after decimal.  After decimal digits: 0 3 6 1 0 7 0 3 3 6 6 7... we need 11 digits: positions 1-11: 0,3,6,1,0,7,0,3,3,6,6. The 12th digit is 7, which will cause rounding.  So we have 6193.03610703366 then round based on next digit 7 => round up last digit (6) to 7. So becomes 6193.03610703367.  Thus 15 significant digits: 4 before decimal + 11 after = 15.

Let's compute.  5 * 544,533 = 2,722,665. So remainder 2.2520004519.

Significant digits include all non-leading zeros. Count: 5 4 4 5 3 3 . 4 5 0 4 0 0 0 9 0 4 = 16? Let's count: before decimal 6 digits, after decimal 10 digits = total 16. Need at most 15. Could round to 15 significant digits. Let's produce 15 significant digits.  Significant digits start from first non-zero: 5 is first. Need 15 total.  We have digits: 5(1) 4(2) 4(3) 5(4) 3(5) 3(6) . 4(7) 5(8) 0(9) 4(10) 0(11) 0(12) 0(13) 9(14) 0(15) 4(16). So need to drop last digit (4) rounding.  So 15 significant digits: 544533.450400090? Wait we need to round at 15th digit. The 15th digit is the 0 after 9? Let's list with positions:  1:5 2:4 3:4 4:5 5:3 6:3 7:4 (first after decimal) 8:5 9:0 10:4 11:0 12:0 13:0 14:9 15:0 16:4  So 15th digit is 0 (the second after decimal? Actually after decimal we have .4504000904. Let's write decimal part: 4504000904.  Positions after decimal: 1:4 (overall 7) 2:5 (8) 3:0 (9) 4:4 (10) 5:0 (11) 6:0 (12) 7:0 (13) 8:9 (14) 9:0 (15) 10:4 (16)  Thus 15th significant digit corresponds to the 9th decimal place (value 0). Next digit (16th) is 4, which would round up? Since next digit is 4 (<5), we keep 0.

Check more precisely: 25434.309395 /3 = ?  Let's do long division: 3*8478 = 25434. remainder 0.309395. So indeed 8478 + 0.309395/3 = 8478 + 0.1031316666666667 = 8478.1031316666667.  Round to at most 15 significant digits. The number has 4 digits before decimal, so total 15 significant digits means 11 decimal places. We have 8478.103131666667 (rounded to 12 decimal places?). Let's count: digits: 8,4,7,8 (4), then decimal, then digits: 1 0 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 7? Let's produce 11 decimal places: after decimal we need 11 digits to make total 15? Actually significant digits count all digits excluding leading zeros. So we have 4 integer digits, need 11 more digits after decimal to reach 15. So we should give 11 decimal digits.  Our value: 8478.1031316666667... Let's get 11 decimal digits: after decimal: 1 0 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 6? Let's round the 12th digit.  We have repeating 6 after 8478.103131666666... Actually the exact fraction: 0.309395/3 = 0.103131666666666666... because 0.309395 = 309395/1,000,000. Divide by 3 gives 309395/3,000,000 = simplify? 309395/3,000,000 = 0.103131666666666666... Indeed after 0.103131, the 6 repeats.  So decimal expansion: 0.103131666666... So after decimal: 1 0 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 ...  Thus 11 decimal digits: 10313166666? Let's list: positions:  1:1 2:0 3:3 4:1 5:3 6:1 7:6 8:6 9:6 10:6 11:6  So 11 digits after decimal: 10313166666. The next digit (12th) is 6, so we round up the 11th digit (which is 6) -> becomes 7? Actually rounding 6 with following 6 => round up, making 6 become 7. So we get 10313166667.  Thus final number: 8478.10313166667.  Check significance: integer part 4 digits + 11 decimal = 15 digits.

That's 9 before decimal, then need 6 after decimal to make 15 total. So keep 6 decimal digits: 242077? Let's round the 7th decimal digit (the 7th after decimal) is 6? Actually we have decimal digits: 2 4 2 0 7 6 5. The 7th is 5, we keep 6 digits: 242076, then look at next digit 5 => round up last digit 6 to 7. So decimal becomes 242077.

Wait 0.0000000586 = 5.86e-8, negative => -5.86e-8. 0.0000031 = 3.1e-6 -0.000000156 = -1.56e-7? Actually 0.000000156 = 1.56e-7, negative => -1.56e-7.  Now sum:  Sum = -2.85e-6 + (-5.86e-8) + 3.1e-6 + (-1.56e-7).  Combine.  First combine the e-6 terms: -2.85e-6 + 3.1e-6 = 0.25e-6? Actually 3.1 - 2.85 = 0.25. So 0.25e-6 = 2.5e-7.  Now add the other terms: -5.86e-8 -1.56e-7 = -(5.86e-8 + 1.56e-7). 1.56e-7 = 15.6e-8. So sum = -(5.86e-8 + 15.6e-8) = -21.46e-8 = -2.146e-7.  Now total sum = 2.5e-7 + (-2.146e-7) = (2.5 - 2.146) e-7 = 0.354e-7 = 3.54e-8.  So sum = 3.54e-8 = 0.0000000354.  Now mean = sum / 4 = 3.54e-8 / 4 = 0.885e-8 = 8.85e-9.

Our value 0.074483538621345714. The 16th digit after decimal? Let's write full: 0.074483538621345714. Digits after decimal: 0 7 4 4 8 3 5 3 8 6 2 1 3 4 5 7 1 4? Wait need to list: Actually decimal part: 074483538621345714. Starting after decimal: 0? No decimal part begins with 074... The first digit after decimal is 0? Actually number is 0.074..., so decimal digits: 0,7,4,4,8,3,5,3,8,6,2,1,3,4,5,7,1,4. So we have 18 digits. We need 15 significant digits, starting from first non-zero digit which is 7 (the second digit after decimal). So we take 15 digits starting from that 7: digits: 7,4,4,8,3,5,3,8,6,2,1,3,4,5,7. That's 15 digits. Next digit is 1 (the 16th significant digit). Since it's less than 5, we keep as is. So 0.0744835386213457 is correct.

First a1 + a2 = 0.662458012 + 0.662458062 = 1.324916074  Add a3: 1.324916074 + 0.662457557 = 1.987373631  Add a4: +0.662457326 = 2.649830957  Add a5: +0.662458342 = 3.312289299  So total fractional sum = 3.312289299  Now total sum = 43,938,290 + 3.312289299 = 43,938,293.312289299  Now divide by 5: 43,938,293.312289299 /5 = ?  Compute: 43,938,293 /5 = 8,787,658.6 (since 5*8,787,658 = 43,938,290). Remainder 3.312289299 /5 = 0.6624578598? Let's compute precisely.  We have total = 43,938,293.312289299.  Divide: 43,938,293.312289299 /5 = 8,787,658.6624578598? Let's compute.  We know 5 * 8,787,658 = 43,938,290. Subtract from total: remainder = 3.312289299.  Now remainder /5 = 0.6624578598.  Add to 8,787,658 gives 8,787,658.6624578598.  Check rounding to 15 significant digits. Number is about 8.78765866245786e6. Significant digits: we can give up to 15 digits total (not decimal places). Provide decimal representation with enough digits.  Our result: 8787658.66245786? Let's compute more precisely remainder/5.  3.312289299 /5 = 0.6624578598 exactly? Let's compute: 5 * 0.6624578598 = 3.312289299. Yes because 0.6624578598 *5 = 3.312289299. So exact to 10 decimal places.  Thus mean = 8,787,658.6624578598.  We can round to 15 significant digits. Count digits: 8787658.66245786 has 15 significant digits? Let's count: ignoring leading zeros, digits: 8 7 8 7 6 5 8 (7 digits before decimal) then after decimal: 6 6 2 4 5 7 8 5 9 8 (10 digits) total 17. Need at most 15. So we need round to 15 significant digits.  Take first 15 digits: Starting from first non-zero: 8 7 8 7 6 5 8 . 6 6 2 4 5 7 8 (that's 14? let's count). Let's list with positions:  1:8 2:7 3:8 4:7 5:6 6:5 7:8 8: (decimal point not count) 9:6 10:6 11:2 12:4 13:5 14:7 15:8 16:5 17:9 18:8  We need 15 significant digits, so up to digit 15 = the '8' after decimal (the 7th decimal digit). So we keep up to that digit and round the next digit (which is 5) to round.  Digits up to 15: 8787658.6624578  Next digit is 5 (the 16th significant digit). Since it's 5, round up the last kept digit (8) by 1 -> becomes 9? But careful: rounding 8 with next digit 5 => round up to 9. So result becomes 8787658.6624579.

Let's compute:  456,527,058.195941 / 4 = 114,131,764.54898525 (since 4*114,131,764 = 456,527,056; remainder .? Let's compute precisely:  114,131,764 *4 = 456,527,056 Remaining .54898525*4 = 2.195941? Wait we need to compute division precisely.  Better: 456,527,058.195941 / 2 = 228,263,529.0979705 Then /2 again = 114,131,764.54898525  Yes.  Since sum is negative, mean = -114,131,764.54898525  Round to at most 15 significant digits. This number has 12 digits before decimal, plus decimal part. 15 significant digits total: we have 12 integer digits, need 3 more significant digits from decimal. So we can give -1.14131764548985e8? But they want decimal not scientific? They said decimal not fraction, but scientific notation is also decimal? Safer to give full decimal with enough digits, maybe -114131764.548985. That's 12 integer digits + 6 decimal = 18 significant digits, exceeding 15 but okay? They said at most 15 significant digits. So we need to round to 15 significant digits.  Number: 114,131,764.54898525  Significant digits count from first non-zero: 1 1 4 1 3 1 7 6 4 .5 4 8 9 8 5 2 5 etc.  We need 15 digits: let's list:  1:1 2:1 3:4 4:1 5:3 6:1 7:7 8:6 9:4 10:5 (first decimal) 11:4 12:8 13:9 14:8 15:5  So keep up to the 15th digit which is the 5 after decimal (the second decimal place? Actually after decimal we have .5 4 8 9 8 5 ... So digits: .5 (10), 4 (11), 8 (12), 9 (13), 8 (14), 5 (15). So we round after that digit. Next digit (16th) is 2 (from .25). Since next digit is 2 <5, we keep as is.  Thus rounded value: 114,131,764.548985  Check: we have integer part 9 digits? Actually integer part is 9? Wait 114,131,764 is 9 digits. Yes 9 integer digits, plus 6 decimal digits = 15 total.  Thus mean = -114131764.548985  Return JSON.",975.0,229.0,1204.0,,,700.0,,0.0,0.0,160.0,0.00061935,False,,3.435e-05,0.000585

Then plus 1.19891 = 15609.19891? Wait need careful: 7804.608025599456 = 7804 + 0.608025599456. Similarly second = 7804 + 0.608025599454. Sum integer parts: 7804+7804 = 15608. Sum fractional: 0.608025599456+0.608025599454 = 1.21605119891? Let's add: 0.608025599456 + 0.608025599454 = 1.21605119891 (since 0.608025599456+0.608025599454 = 1.21605119891). So total sum = 15608 + 1.21605119891 = 15609.21605119891. Yes earlier sum 15609.21605119891. Divide by 2 = 7804.608025599455. So answer is 7804.608025599455.

Now sum = a + (b + c) = 0.0001055887967 + 5.02e-11 = 0.0001055887967502? Actually 0.0001055887967 + 0.0000000000502 = 0.0001055888469? Wait 0.0001055887967 + 0.0000000000502 = 0.0001055888469? Let's align decimal places:  0.0001055887967 +0.0000000000502 =0.0001055888469? Let's add:  0.0001055887967 0.0000000000502 =0.0001055888469 (since 7967 + 502 = 8469 in the last 4 digits). Yes that matches earlier 0.0001055888469. So my earlier sum is correct. The alternative calculation gave 5.02e-11, but adding to a yields 0.0001055887967 + 0.0000000000502 = 0.0001055888469 indeed because 0.0001055887967 + 0.0000000000502 = 0.0001055888469 (since 7967 + 502 = 8469). So sum = 0.0001055888469.  Now divide by 3: 0.0001055888469 / 3 = 0.0000351962823? Let's compute: 105.5888469e-6 /3 = 35.1962823e-6 = 0.0000351962823. Multiply back: 0.0000351962823 *3 = 0.0001055888469 exactly? 0.0000351962823*3 = 0.0001055888469 (since 35.1962823*3 = 105.5888469). Yes.  Thus answer: 0.0000351962823.

Let's compute precisely.  0.9513302538973952 -0.9503502104885480 =0.0009800434088472 (yes)  So sum = -0.0000009800434088472? Actually negative of that difference times e-6: -0.000000 (0.0009800434088472)?? Let's be careful.  We have -0.9513302538973952e-6 + 0.950350210488548e-6 = (-0.9513302538973952 + 0.950350210488548) e-6 = (-0.0009800434088472) e-6 = -0.0000000009800434088472? Wait e-6 means multiply by 10^-6. So -0.0009800434088472 *10^-6 = -0.0000000009800434088472? Actually -0.000980043... * 1e-6 = -9.800434088472e-10. Let's compute directly: -0.0000009513302538973952 + 0.000000950350210488548 = -(0.0000009513302538973952 - 0.000000950350210488548) = -(0.0000000009800434088472) = -9.800434088472e-10.  Yes sum = -9.800434088472e-10.  Now mean = sum /4 = -9.800434088472e-10 /4 = -2.450108522118e-10? Compute: 9.800434088472 /4 = 2.450108522118. So -2.450108522118e-10.  Thus answer -2.450108522118e-10 = -0.0000000002450108522118? Wait exponent: e-10 means 10^-10. So -2.450108522118 ×10^-10 = -0.0000000002450108522118 (that's 2.45e-10). Provide decimal.  Let's output with sufficient digits: -2.450108522118e-10 is acceptable as decimal? They said if not integer, give as decimal (not fraction). Exponential notation is a decimal representation? Might be okay but better give plain decimal: -0.0000000002450108522118 (that's 2.450108522118e-10). Count digits: after decimal point 10 zeros? Actually 0.000000000245... that's 9 zeros after decimal before 2? Let's write: 0.0000000002450108522118. That's 9 zeros then 245... Let's verify: 10^-10 = 0.0000000001 (9 zeros then 1). So 2.45e-10 = 0.000000000245. Yes.  Thus answer.",1058.0,239.0,1297.0,,,699.0,,0.0,0.0,192.0,0.00067065,False,,3.585e-05,0.0006348

Let's compute.  Divide 62416.394414000114 by 4:  62416 /4 = 15604 0.394414000114 /4 = 0.0986035000285 (since 0.394414 /4 = 0.0986035). Let's compute precisely:  0.394414000114 /4 = 0.0986035000285 (since 0.394414 /4 = 0.0986035, extra .000000000114/4 = 0.0000000000285). So total = 15604.0986035000285.  Thus mean = 15604.0986035000285. Need at most 15 significant digits. Let's round to 15 significant digits.  Number: 15604.0986035000285  Significant digits count from first non-zero: 1 5 6 0 4 . 0 9 8 6 0 3 5 0 0 ...  We need 15 significant digits. Let's count:  1:1 2:5 3:6 4:0 5:4 6:0 (the digit after decimal) 7:9 8:8 9:6 10:0 11:3 12:5 13:0 14:0 15:0  So up to the 15th digit is the third zero after decimal? Let's write full number with digits:  15604.0986035000285 Write without decimal: 156040986035000285? Wait that's not correct. Let's list digits:  Integer part: 1 5 6 0 4 Decimal part: 0 9 8 6 0 3 5 0 0 0 2 8 5  Combine: 1 5 6 0 4 . 0 9 8 6 0 3 5 0 0 0 2 8 5  Now count significant digits: start at first non-zero (1). Count across decimal.  1:1 2:5 3:6 4:0 5:4 6:0 (first decimal digit) 7:9 8:8 9:6 10:0 11:3 12:5 13:0 14:0 15:0  Thus 15th digit is the third zero after decimal (the one at position decimal digits index 8? Let's map decimal positions:  Decimal digits index: 1:0 (position 6) 2:9 (7) 3:8 (8) 4:6 (9) 5:0 (10) 6:3 (11) 7:5 (12) 8:0 (13) 9:0 (14) 10:0 (15) 11:2 (16) 12:8 (17) 13:5 (18)  So 15th significant digit is the third zero (decimal digit 10). So we need to round at that digit. The next digit (11th decimal digit) is 2, which is less than 5, so we keep as is.  Thus rounded to 15 significant digits: 15604.09860350000? Wait we need to include up to that digit. So we have integer part 15604, decimal part up to 10 decimal places? Let's see: we have 5 integer digits, need total 15 significant digits, so need 10 decimal digits (since 5 integer digits). So we keep 10 decimal digits.

Let's verify addition: 0.013976124536695154 + 0.004658708134200376 = 0.01863483267089553. Yes.  Now divide by 4: 0.01863483267089553 / 4 = 0.0046587081677238825? Let's compute.  0.01863483267089553 / 2 = 0.009317416335447765 Divide by 2 again (to get /4): 0.009317416335447765 / 2 = 0.0046587081677238825.  Check rounding to 15 significant digits. The number is 0.0046587081677238825. Significant digits start after leading zeros: 4.65870816772388e-3. Count 15 significant digits: 4 6 5 8 7 0 8 1 6 7 7 2 3 8 8? Let's list digits: 4,6,5,8,7,0,8,1,6,7,7,2,3,8,8,2,5... Actually we have many. Need at most 15 significant digits. So we can round to 15 digits: 0.004658708167724? Let's count.  Write number: 0.0046587081677238825 Remove leading zeros: 4.6587081677238825e-3. Significant digits: 4 6 5 8 7 0 8 1 6 7 7 2 3 8 8 2 5.  Take first 15: 4 6 5 8 7 0 8 1 6 7 7 2 3 8 8. That's 15 digits. So we need to round at the 15th digit (the last 8). The next digit is 2, so round down (stay 8). So result: 0.00465870816772388? Wait we need to produce 15 significant digits.

We can do long division: 172,847,087,714.1628 /3.  172,847,087,714 ÷3 = 57,615,695,904 remainder 2? Actually 57,615,695,904 *3 = 172,847,087,712. Subtract from 172,847,087,714.1628 gives 2.1628.  Now 2.1628 /3 = 0.720933333... Wait 2.1628/3 = 0.720933333... Actually 2.1628/3 = 0.720933333333... because 2.16/3=0.72, plus 0.0028/3=0.000933333... So total 0.720933333...

Let's write decimal with appropriate precision.  57,615,695,904.7209333 (that's 17 digits before decimal, plus decimals). Significant digits count includes all digits starting from first non-zero. So we have 17 digits before decimal, already exceed 15, so we can give full integer part and maybe few decimals. But requirement: at most 15 significant digits. So we need to round to 15 significant digits total.  The integer part has 11? Wait count: 57,615,695,904 is 11 digits? Let's count: 57,615,695,904 -> digits: 5 7 6 1 5 6 9 5 9 0 4 = 11 digits. Actually 57 billion is 11 digits. Yes 11 digits. So we can include up to 4 more significant digits after decimal to reach 15 total.  Thus we need to round to 4 decimal places (since 11 integer digits). So we keep 4 decimal digits: 57,615,695,904.7209 (since next digit is 3, round down). So answer 57615695904.7209.

Round to at most 15 significant digits. The number has many digits. 5.136062323584831 (that's 16 significant digits? Let's count: digits excluding leading zero: 5 (1), .136062323584831 (15 more) total 16. Need at most 15. So we can round to 15 significant digits.  Significant digits count from first non-zero digit. So we need 15 digits total. Let's produce 15 digits.  Current: 5.136062323584831125  Write digits: 5 1 3 6 0 6 2 3 2 3 5 8 4 8 3 1 1 2 5 ...  We need 15 digits: that would be 5.13606232358483?

First, note they are all ~558.117649028... Let's compute differences from a base maybe.  Take base 558.117649028000 for convenience.  Compute each deviation:  1) 0.000000000395 2) 0.000000000 - actually 558.117649027918 - base = -0.000000000082? Wait base 558.117649028000, subtract: 558.117649027918 = base - 0.000000000082. So deviation -8.2e-11.  3) 558.117649028942 = base + 0.000000000942  4) 558.117649029286 = base + 0.000000001286  5) 558.117649029307 = base + 0.000000001307  Now sum deviations:  0.000000000395 -0.000000000082 = -8.2e-11 +0.000000000942 +0.000000001286 +0.000000001307  Add them:  First sum positives: 0.000000000395 + 0.000000000942 = 0.000000001337 Add 0.000000001286 = 0.000000002623 Add 0.000000001307 = 0.00000000393  Now subtract 0.000000000082: 0.00000000393 - 0.000000000082 = 0.000000003848  So total deviation sum = 3.848e-9.  Now sum of base values: 5 * 558.117649028000 = 2790.58824514? Let's compute: 558.117649028 *5 = 558*5=2790, .117649028*5 = 0.58824514. So total = 2790.58824514.  Now add total deviation sum: 2790.58824514 + 0.000000003848 = 2790.588245143848.  Now mean = total sum /5 = (2790.588245143848)/5 = 558.1176490287696? Let's compute: 2790.588245143848 /5.  5*558 = 2790. So remainder 0.588245143848. Divide 0.588245143848 by5 = 0.1176490287696. So mean = 558 + 0.1176490287696 = 558.1176490287696.  Check rounding to 15 significant digits. Number is 558.11764902877 approx.  Significant digits: 15 total digits not counting decimal point. Let's produce 15 significant digits: 558.11764902877 has digits: 3 before decimal, plus after decimal 12? Let's count: 558 (3), then .11764902877 (11 digits) total 14. Need 15 maybe add one more digit: we have 558.117649028770? Actually we have 558.1176490287696. That's 15 digits? Count: 5 5 8 . 1 1 7 6 4 9 0 2 8 7 6 9 6. Digits ignoring decimal: 5,5,8,1,1,7,6,4,9,0,2,8,7,6,9,6 = 16 digits. So we can round to 15 significant digits: keep first 15 digits: 558.11764902877? Let's see.  Write number with full: 558.1176490287696  Significant digits start from first non-zero: 5 is first. Count 15 digits:  1:5 2:5 3:8 4:1 5:1 6:7 7:6 8:4 9:9 10:0 11:2 12:8 13:7 14:6 15:9  So up to digit 15 is the '9' (the second 9? Actually digits list: after decimal: 1 1 7 6 4 9 0 2 8 7 6 9 6. Let's map:  Positions: 1 5 2 5 3 8 4 1 (first after decimal) 5 1 6 7 7 6 8 4 9 9 10 0 11 2 12 8 13 7 14 6 15 9 16 6  So we need to round at 15th digit (9) based on next digit (6). Since next digit 6 >=5, round up 9 to 10 causing carry. So we need to round the 15th digit up.  Thus the number becomes: digits up to 14 stay same, 15th becomes 10 -> carry to previous.  Let's perform rounding: The sequence up to 14 digits: 558.11764902876 (since digits after decimal: 1 1 7 6 4 9 0 2 8 7 6). Wait need to ensure.  Write number with grouping:  558 . 1176490287696 After decimal: 1 1 7 6 4 9 0 2 8 7 6 9 6  Now 15 significant digits includes integer part 558 (3 digits) plus first 12 decimal digits (since 3+12=15). So we need 12 decimal places.  Decimal digits count: we need 12 decimal digits.  Let's list decimal digits with index:  1:1 2:1 3:7 4:6 5:4 6:9 7:0 8:2 9:8 10:7 11:6 12:9 13:6  We need 12 decimal digits, so up to digit 12 (which is 9). Next digit (13th) is 6, so round.  Thus we round the 12th decimal digit (9) up because next digit 6 >=5, making it 10, carry.  So decimal digits become:  Digits 1-11 stay same: 1 1 7 6 4 9 0 2 8 7 6  Now we need to add 1 to the 12th digit (9) -> becomes 10, so set to 0 and carry 1 to previous digit (11th digit which is 6). So 6 becomes 7. No further carry.  Thus final decimal digits: 1 1 7 6 4 9 0 2 8 7 7 0  So 12 decimal digits: 117649028770  Thus mean rounded to 12 decimal places = 558.117649028770  Check if any trailing zeros can be omitted?

Actually 18.6027145686026 ÷ 3 = 6.2009048562008667 (since 3*6.2009048562008667 = 18.6027145686026). Good.  Thus mean = 6.2009048562008667e-9 = 0.0000000062009048562008667.

After decimal we need total 15 significant digits, so need 10 after decimal (since 5 before). So take first 10 decimal digits: after decimal digits: 5 6 5 9 6 4 1 7 8 0 ... that's 10 digits. So round at the 10th decimal place (the 0). Next digit is 6 (the 11th decimal). Since next digit 6 >=5, we round up the 10th digit (0) to 1. So result: 17249.5659641781?

Compute decimal: 3 * 0.00587451543099 = 0.01762354629297 approx. So answer ~0.00587451543099.  We need at most 15 significant digits. Provide maybe 0.00587451543099 (14 sig digits). Let's round to 15 significant digits: The number is 0.00587451543099333... Significant digits start at first non-zero: 5 8 7 4 5 1 5 4 3 0 9 9 3 3... That's 15 digits: 5 8 7 4 5 1 5 4 3 0 9 9 3 3  ?. Let's compute more precisely.  We can compute using long division: 0.01762354629298 / 3.  3 goes into 0.017 -> 0.005, remainder 0.017 - 0.015 = 0.002. Bring down next digit 6 (since we have decimal). Actually better use high precision: Use Python mental? Let's do using fraction: 0.01762354629298 = 1762354629298e-14? Actually 0.01762354629298 = 1762354629298 / 10^14? Wait 10^14 = 100,000,000,000,000. Yes.  So value = 1762354629298 / 100,000,000,000,000 = simplify? Not needed.  Divide by 3: = 1762354629298 / 300,000,000,000,000 = reduce fraction dividing numerator and denominator by 2? numerator even? 1762354629298 is even, divide by 2 => 881177314649, denominator 150,000,000,000,000. So = 881177314649 / 150,000,000,000,000.  Now compute decimal: 881,177,314,649 / 150,000,000,000,000 = 0.005874515430993333... Let's compute more digits: Multiply 0.005874515430993333 * 150,000,000,000,000 = ?  But we can compute using long division: Let's compute to 16 decimal places.  We want quotient q = numerator / denominator.  Denominator D = 150,000,000,000,000.  We can compute q = 881,177,314,649 / 150,000,000,000,000.  First, 150e12 goes into 881e9? Actually numerator is ~8.8e11, denominator 1.5e14, so q ~0.0058745.  Compute q * 10^15 maybe easier: Multiply numerator by 10^15 then divide by denominator.  But we can compute using high precision: Let's compute q = 0.005874515430993333... Let's verify digits.  Compute D * 0.00587451543099 = ?  0.00587451543099 * 150,000,000,000,000 = 0.00587451543099 * 1.5e14 = 0.00587451543099 * 150,000,000,000,000.  Multiply: 150,000,000,000,000 * 0.005 = 750,000,000,000. Additional 0.00087451543099 * 150e12 = 0.00087451543099 * 150,000,000,000,000 = 131,177,314,648.5? Let's compute precisely: 150e12 * 0.00087451543099 = 150e12 * 874.51543099e-6 = (150e12 * 874.51543099) /1e6 = (131,177,314,648,500) /1e6? Hmm.  Better compute product: 150,000,000,000,000 * 0.00587451543099 = 150,000,000,000,000 * (5.87451543099 /1000) = (150,000,000,000,000 *5.87451543099)/1000.  150e12 *5.87451543099 = 150*5.87451543099 e12 = 881.1773146485 e12? Actually 150*5.87451543099 = 881.1773146485. Multiply by 1e12 => 881,177,314,648,500,000, then divide by 1000 => 881,177,314,648,500. That's close to numerator 881,177,314,649? Wait numerator is 881,177,314,649 (no extra zeros). Our product gave 881,177,314,648,500 which is 1000 times larger. Because we mis-handled scaling.  Let's recalc: q = numerator/denominator. Multiply q * denominator = numerator.  If q = 0.00587451543099, denominator = 150,000,000,000,000.  Compute product: 150,000,000,000,000 * 0.00587451543099 = 150,000,000,000,000 * (5.87451543099 /1000) = (150,000,000,000,000 *5.87451543099)/1000.  150,000,000,000,000 *5.87451543099 = 150e12 *5.87451543099 = (150*5.87451543099) e12 = 881.1773146485 e12 = 881,177,314,648,500,000,000? Wait e12 means multiply by 10^12, so 881.1773146485 *10^12 = 8.811773146485e14? Actually 881.177... *10^12 = 8.811773146485e14? Let's compute: 1e12 = 1,000,000,000,000. Multiply 881.177... by that gives 881,177,314,648,500,000,000? No, 881.177... * 1,000,000,000,000 = 881,177,314,648,500,000,000? Wait 881.177... times 1e12 = 8.81177e14? Let's do: 881.177 * 1e12 = 8.81177e14 (since 881 * 1e12 = 8.81e14). So product = 8.811773146485e14? Actually 881.1773146485 * 1e12 = 8.811773146485e14 = 881,177,314,648,500,000? That's 881,177,314,648,500,000 (that's 15 digits). Then divide by 1000 => 881,177,314,648,500. That's 881,177,314,648,500 which is 1000 times numerator (881,177,314,649). So q is off by factor 1000? Indeed because denominator is 150e12, numerator is 881e9. Ratio ~0.0058745. Multiply denominator by 0.0058745 gives numerator ~0.0058745*150e12 = 0.881e12 = 8.81e11, which matches numerator 8.81e11. So our product should be ~8.81e11, not 8.81e14. Let's compute correctly: denominator = 150,000,000,000,000 = 1.5e14. Multiply by 0.0058745 gives ~8.81175e11. Yes.  So compute: 1.5e14 * 0.00587451543099 = 1.5e14 * (5.87451543099e-3) = (1.5 *5.87451543099) e11 = 8.811773146485 e11 = 881,177,314,648.5. That's close to numerator 881,177,314,649. Good.  Thus q = 0.00587451543099 gives product 881,177,314,648.5, off by 0.5. So actual q slightly larger: difference 0.5 / denominator = 0.5 / 1.5e14 = 3.333...e-15. So q = 0.00587451543099 + 3.33e-15 ≈ 0.00587451543099333. So our earlier value is correct.  Thus answer: 0.00587451543099333 (maybe round to 15 sig digits: 0.00587451543099? That's 14 sig digits. 15 sig digits would be 0.005874515430993? That's 15 digits after leading zeros? Count: digits: 5 8 7 4 5 1 5 4 3 0 9 9 3 = 13? Let's count: 0.00587451543099333. Significant digits start at 5: sequence: 5(1),0? Actually 0 after decimal before 5 are not significant. So digits: 5(1),8(2),7(3),4(4),5(5),1(6),5(7),4(8),3(9),0(10),9(11),9(12),3(13),3(14),3(15). So 15 sig digits would be 0.005874515430993. That's 15 digits up to the third 3? Wait we need 15 significant digits, so we include up to the 15th digit: that is 0.005874515430993 (that's 15 digits: 5 8 7 4 5 1 5 4 3 0 9 9 3). That's 13? Let's recount: after decimal: 0 0 5 8 7 4 5 1 5 4 3 0 9 9 3 3 3? Actually the number is 0.00587451543099333. After decimal we have 0,0,5,8,7,4,5,1,5,4,3,0,9,9,3,3,3. Leading zeros after decimal before first non-zero are not significant. So significant digits start at 5 (the third decimal place). So list of significant digits: 5(1),8(2),7(3),4(4),5(5),1(6),5(7),4(8),3(9),0(10),9(11),9(12),3(13),3(14),3(15). So 15th digit is the third trailing 3. So rounding to 15 sig digits gives 0.00587451543099333 (since we have exactly 15 digits). Actually we have 15 digits already, so we can give full value. Provide maybe 0.00587451543099333.

We can sum as decimal:  a=0.284861742051 b=0.284861742056 c=0.284861742065  Add: Let's add column wise.  0.284861742051 +0.284861742056 = 0.569723484107 +0.284861742065 = 0.854585226172  Now divide by 3.  We can compute using fraction: 0.854585226172 = 854585226172e-12? Actually it's 0.854585226172.  Divide: 0.854585226172 / 3 = ?  3 goes into 0.8 => 0.2 remainder 0.254585226172.  But better use arithmetic: 0.854585226172 * (1/3) = 0.284861742057333333...  Because 0.284861742057 *3 = 0.854585226171, missing 0.000000000001.  Let's compute more precisely: Use high precision: 0.854585226172 / 3 = ?  Take 854585226172 / 3 = 284861742057.333... then place decimal 12 places: 0.284861742057333...  Thus answer 0.284861742057333.  Round to at most 15 significant digits. That's 0.284861742057333 (15 digits after leading zero? Significant digits count from first non-zero: 2 8 4 8 6 1 7 4 2 0 5 7 3 3 3 = 15 digits). So output that.",598.0,217.0,815.0,,,443.0,,0.0,0.0,192.0,0.00039135,False,,3.255e-05,0.0003588

Thousands: 640 + 004 = 644 -> thousand part 644 Millions: 291 + 802 = 1,093 -> that's 1 billion 93 million? Actually 291 million + 802 million = 1,093 million = 1 billion 93 million. So carry 1 to billions, millions remainder 93. Billions: 22 + 41 + 1 (carry) = 64 billions.  So result: 64 billions, 93 million, 644 thousand, 998.  Thus integer sum = 64,093,644,998.  Now add decimal .9 + .9 = 1.8, so total sum = 64,093,644,998 + 1.8 = 64,093,645, - actually 64,093,644,999.8? Wait adding 1.8 to integer 64,093,644,998 gives 64,093,644,999.8? No, 64,093,644,998 + 1 = 64,093,644,999; +0.8 = 64,093,644,999.8. So sum of first two = 64,093,644,999.8.  Now add third: -47451486954.9  Compute 64,093,644,999.8 - 47,451,486,954.9 = ?  64,093,644,999.8 - 47,451,486,954.9 = 16,642,158,044.9? Let's subtract:  64,093,644,999.8 -47,451,486,954.9 =16,642,158,044.9 (since .8 - .9 = -0.1, borrow 1 => .8+1 =1.8, 1.8-0.9=0.9, and reduce integer by 1). Compute integer: 64,093,644,999 - 47,451,486,954 = 16,642,158,045. Then after borrowing 1, becomes 16,642,158,044. So result = 16,642,158,044.9. Yes.  Now add fourth: -16690310008.8  16,642,158,044.9 - 16,690,310,008.8 = ?  16,642,158,044.9 - 16,690,310,008.8 = -48,151,963.9?

Mean = sum / 4 = -48,151,963.9 / 4 = -12,037,990.975? Compute: 48,151,963.9 /4 = 12,037,990.975. Negative sign.  So answer -12037990.975.  Check rounding: keep as decimal.

Since next digit 5, round up the 15th digit (0) to 1. So we get 257197663375351 (15 digits). Now place decimal after 6 digits (since original had 6 integer digits). So number = 257197.663375351? Let's verify: integer part 257197 (6 digits). The remaining 9 digits after decimal: we have total 15 digits, 6 integer, 9 fractional. Our rounded digits after integer: we need 9 fractional digits: from the 15-digit number: 257197663375351 -> split: integer 257197, fractional 663375351. Yes.

To keep same exponent 1e-10: d = -0.5813e-10.  So sum in e-10 units: (-4.962 + 7.475 -1.643 -0.5813) e-10 = (7.475 -4.962 = 2.513; 2.513 -1.643 = 0.870; 0.870 -0.5813 = 0.2887) e-10.

Actually numbers have up to 13 decimal places after decimal point? Let's count: -0.0000000004962 has 10 zeros after decimal then 4962 (4 digits). So total 13 decimal places? Actually decimal representation: 0.0000000004962 = 4.962e-10, which has 10 zeros then 4962. So precision maybe 4 significant digits. Our result 7.2175e-12 has 5 significant digits. Could round to maybe 7.218e-12? But we can give as decimal with up to 15 significant digits. Let's compute more precisely using exact values.  Let's compute sum exactly using decimal arithmetic.  Write each number with same exponent 1e-13 maybe? Let's convert to 1e-13 units.  -0.0000000004962 = -496.2e-13? Actually 0.0000000004962 = 4.962e-10 = 4962e-13.

Compute -4962 -1643 = -6605. Then -6605 -581.3 = -7186.3. Add 7475 => 288.7. So sum = 288.7e-13 = 2.887e-11 (consistent).  Now mean = 288.7e-13 /4 = 72.175e-13 = 7.2175e-12.  Thus decimal: 0.0000000000072175.  Check number of zeros: after decimal point, we need 9 zeros? Let's write: 1e-12 = 0.000000000001 (that's 12 decimal places after decimal? Actually count: decimal point then 12 zeros then 1? Let's count: 0.000000000001 has 12 zeros after decimal before 1. So 7.2175e-12 = 0.0000000000072175 (that's 11 zeros? Let's count: positions: 0.
