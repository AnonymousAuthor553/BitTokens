It's that classic problem: how do we calculate a fractional exponent efficiently? In this specific case, it's 0.60852107419528 raised to the power of 0.2. But, and here's the trick, raising something to the power of 0.2 is the same as finding its fifth root. So, essentially, what we're after is the fifth root of 0.60852107419528.  Now, to make this easier to work with algebraically, let's represent the answer as 'x'. So, if 'x' is the solution, we can set up an equation. 'x' equals 0.60852107419528 to the power of 0.2. This directly translates to x^5 = 0.60852107419528. This should make it easier to conceptualize the problem and think of the appropriate methods to solve it, whether it be iteration, a calculator function, or potentially leveraging a series expansion.",142,16,274,116,142,116,16,16,274,132

Adding it all up: 360,000 + 16,800 + 196 gives me 376,996.  Now, I've got to multiply that result by 614 again. Since I'm approximating, I'll bump that 376,996 up to 377,000.
