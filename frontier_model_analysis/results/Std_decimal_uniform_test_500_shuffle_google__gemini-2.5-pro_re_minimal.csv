No problem, this is pretty straightforward. I'll just run through the steps in my head.  First, I need to find the mean of the dataset. That's simply adding up all the numbers and dividing by the count – which is 4 in this case.  Easy peasy. Then, I'll calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. These are my deviations from the average.  Next, I square each of those differences. Squaring gets rid of any negative values and ensures we're dealing with magnitudes of deviation.  The squaring step is crucial here.  After that, I'll sum up all the squared differences.  This sum of squared differences is almost the variance. To get the variance, I'd divide this sum by the number of data points (or the number of data points minus 1 if it's a sample variance, but I'll assume population here for simplicity).  Finally, the standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance. And that's it!

Simple enough. My first thought is to grab the standard deviation formula. Now, since they just said ""std,"" my intuition is to go with the sample standard deviation. With such a small dataset, it's the more common choice. That would be `s = sqrt(Σ(x_i - μ)² / (n - 1))`, where *s* is the sample standard deviation, *x_i* are the individual data points, *μ* is the sample mean, and *n* is the number of data points.

It's a small dataset, only four data points.  I need to figure out the standard deviation of this.  A standard deviation tells me how spread out these values are from the mean, right?  Let's see, I'll need to... first, calculate the mean. Then, I'll subtract the mean from each data point, square those differences, sum those squared differences, divide by the number of data points minus one (since it's a sample, not a population - that's *n-1*), and finally, take the square root of that whole thing. That'll give me the standard deviation.  Easy peasy.",21,200,342,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""answer"": 511.961493843363}",,,200,21,342,121,121,21,142
