That's 9 zeros after decimal before 1? Actually decimal representation: 0.0000000001 has 9 zeros after decimal then 1.

That's 18 digits after decimal. The prefix ""0000355967"" is 10 digits? Let's just compare numeric values.  We can compare the 11th digit after decimal (the first after the shared prefix). The prefix ""0000355967"" is 10 digits. The next digit:  1: after ""0000355967"" the next digit is ""1"" (since ...715...). Actually the sequence after prefix: 1 5 5 3 4 8 5 1.  2: after prefix: ""0"" (since ...703...). So 0 is smaller than 1, so second number is smaller than first.  Check fourth: after prefix: ""0"" as well? It is ...704..., so after prefix digit is ""0"". Then need next digit to compare between second and fourth.  Second digits after prefix: second number digits: ""0 3 5 8 6 4 7 0 7""? Actually after prefix ""0000355967"", the remaining part is ""035864707"". So digits: 0,3,5,8,6,4,7,0,7.  Fourth number: after prefix ""0000355967"", remaining ""046350209"". Digits: 0,4,6,3,5,0,2,0,9.  Compare second vs fourth: first differing digit after prefix is second digit: second number has 3, fourth has 4. Since 3 < 4, second number is smaller than fourth.  Third number after prefix: ""20..."" which starts with 2, larger.  Fifth after prefix: ""15..."" starts with 1, larger than 0.  Thus minimum is second number: 0.0000355967035864707.
