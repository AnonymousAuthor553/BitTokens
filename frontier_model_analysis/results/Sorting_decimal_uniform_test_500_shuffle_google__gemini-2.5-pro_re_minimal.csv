No problem, this should be straightforward.  Let's take a look at these numbers: I see a string of zeroes before the significant digits. I know I have to compare the *magnitude* of the decimals first.  The trick here is just to mentally account for the zeroes.  I can immediately see that the second number, with the most zeroes following the decimal point, is the smallest.  It's `0.00000000000049`. That one goes first, for sure.  Now, between the first (`0.0000000000049`) and the third (`0.00000000000671`), I just need to compare the digits *after* the repeated zeroes. So, effectively, I'm comparing 49 to 671.  Since 49 is smaller, the first number should go next. That leaves the third number as the second largest.  I'm assuming the fourth value is a typo. So, the sort should read: 0.00000000000049, 0.0000000000049, 0.00000000000671.  Simple enough.

The first number, '2077594019', immediately tells me the first number is greater than '1372286983' and '140284146'. The number with a leading '13' has to come before the numbers starting with a '14' and '20'. So far, I have '1372286983' as the smallest.  I can also immediately see that '140284146' is smaller than '2077594019' and '2618200316'. So, I need to compare the last two. They both start with 26 and 20. Clearly, '2077594019' is less than '2618200316'. This is a quick and straightforward mental sorting task, given the structure of the input. I quickly see the order is: 1. 0.00001372286983 2. 0.0000140284146 3. 0.00002077594019 4. 0.00002618200316",74,178,366,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""answer"": [0.00001372286983, 0.0000140284146, 0.00002077594019, 0.00002618200316]}",,,178,74,366,114,114,74,188
